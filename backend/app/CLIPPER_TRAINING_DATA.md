# SECTION 6: FULL TRANSCRIPT EXAMPLES

## Example 1: "Follow Your Passion?..."

**Channel:** alex_hormozi | **Score:** 81.8 | **Views:** 120,382
**Pattern Used:** STATEMENT HOOK

### Hook (First 3 seconds):
> Chris Rock has a great saying, he says, follow your dreams, if they're hiring. You

### Full Transcript:
```
Chris Rock has a great saying, he says, follow your dreams, if they're hiring. You are fooling yourself. You have this idea, I'm gonna pursue what I'm passionate about, I'm gonna paint paintings all day, but even then, it's not true. To pursue your passion is only true in the vague and never in the specific, and I only say this as somebody who fucking went all the way with it. I was into fitness and I started the gyms and I scaled the gyms and I did the turnarounds and I scaled to 6,000 locations, I started a software company, I started a software company, I sold all of it to private equity. I did the whole thing, and what do I have today? A gym that has no members, and I love it, but it's not what I make money on. You're using the excuse of passion to disguise your inability to tolerate hardness.

## Example 2: "Trying To Get Rich Fast Is Keeping You Poor..."

**Channel:** alex_hormozi | **Score:** 80.2 | **Views:** 43,183
**Pattern Used:** CONTRARIAN STATEMENT

### Hook (First 3 seconds):
> Poor people stay poor because they want a fast way to get rich. You'd be

### Full Transcript:
```
Poor people stay poor because they want a fast way to get rich. You'd be surprised how far you can get by only knowing what you want and not accepting anything else until you get it. It's very hard to have a vision when you have bills to pay. Focusing on many things is a great way to fill up your calendar and empty your bank account.

## Example 3: "The Market Won't Lie To You..."

**Channel:** alex_hormozi | **Score:** 78.9 | **Views:** 28,982
**Pattern Used:** STATEMENT HOOK

### Hook (First 3 seconds):
> People want to protect your feelings, your friends, your family. They don't want you to

### Full Transcript:
```
People want to protect your feelings, your friends, your family. They don't want you to feel bad. The market does not care. And if you want truth, the market will give you the truth. And as long as you can humble yourself and listen to the market, the amount I've grown as an entrepreneur versus when I was not an entrepreneur, it pales in comparison, because it will tell you where you suck. If I made content that no one liked, I would have to change, right? I'd have to change what I was doing. And if you make products that no one wants to buy, you have to change what you're doing. If when you get in front of somebody and no one wants to buy, you have to change what you're saying. Period.

## Example 4: "Ray ROASTS Mike Majlak! 😂😭..."

**Channel:** impaulsive | **Score:** 77.9 | **Views:** 11,333,511
**Pattern Used:** QUESTION HOOK

### Hook (First 3 seconds):
> How old are you? I'm 30. I'm unk. Yeah, don't, bro. Just wait till I

### Full Transcript:
```
How old are you? I'm 30. I'm unk. Yeah, don't, bro. Just wait till I get to him. This dude is pushing 85. How old are you? Now that's a Hollywood. I'm 40. Stop with family, bro. What the fuck? Why? Are you too old for this shit, bro? Why?

## Example 5: "Advice I Would Give To Someone In Their 20's..."

**Channel:** modern_wisdom | **Score:** 77.5 | **Views:** 115,280
**Pattern Used:** STATEMENT HOOK

### Hook (First 3 seconds):
> Any piece of advice for someone, or for me, I'm about to graduate, do you

### Full Transcript:
```
Any piece of advice for someone, or for me, I'm about to graduate, do you have any piece of advice? How old are you? 22. You've been in full-time education for 17 years. All you've done is, I know when to get up, I know what I'm working toward. Everything is laid out in front of you. It's like you're being on a train ride, and now somebody said, okay, now you get to freewheel drive this off-road vehicle. There's no roads at all. I would say, things that I did that were good, I wasn't worried about work-life balance, and I allowed my obsessions and my instincts to drive me. So, if I got obsessed with something, ping-pong, or video games, or writing, or travel, or whatever it is, I allowed myself to do that, because the degrees of freedom you have are going to be constricted as time goes on. Travel is really great. If you ever feel lost, interestingly enough, purposefully geographically losing yourself is really good. So, I would front-load travel. I would follow your instincts. I would not feel worried about the uncertainty. I think the uncertainty is absolutely a part of it. Like, it is 100% meant to be there.

## Example 6: "Ilhan Omar Warns Trump Supporters Might Target Som..."

**Channel:** pbd_podcast | **Score:** 76.7 | **Views:** 61,745
**Pattern Used:** STATEMENT HOOK

### Hook (First 3 seconds):
> Ilhan Omar says Trump supporters might attack Somalis, that's what she said here, to Jake

### Full Transcript:
```
Ilhan Omar says Trump supporters might attack Somalis, that's what she said here, to Jake Tapper who called her a white woman probably. Go ahead. I mean it creates fear and there is a possible danger that a lot of the people who follow the president have exhibited violence in many cases, especially in my case, whenever he has said something about me that is derogatory or says I'm a threat to the country, I've gotten death threats. There are so many people that have been incarcerated over the years that have been encouraged by the president's words and so there is fear for Somalis not just in Minnesota but across the country that some of these people might attack and harm them.

## Example 7: "You Need ACTIVE Income First..."

**Channel:** alex_hormozi | **Score:** 76.4 | **Views:** 205,449
**Pattern Used:** STATEMENT HOOK

### Hook (First 3 seconds):
> How do I work myself out of this just being self-employment? Just not having to

### Full Transcript:
```
How do I work myself out of this just being self-employment? Just not having to work but still making money off of what he built? What needs to be true? Dude, you're so far away from that I wouldn't even think about it. Like, you trying to get to passive income right now? Like, you don't even have active income right now. Like, this is not even a question. I'm just being real with you. Yeah. I would like to help. The idea of like, I would like to make passive. Sure, man. Everyone just wants money in the mail. It doesn't work that way. Like, you need to make active income really cool for you for a while. And I will tell you this. Making more money, tons of fun. Especially at the levels that you're at right now. The increase in income that you make has a material change on your life. Like, you won't want to get out of making it once you start making more of it. You'll start liking the game. Because right now, I don't think you like the game yet. I don't feel that. Yeah. Because you're already asking, how do I not work to make the money? Right. Right. Like, you have a whole lot of shit to get through. You're like the beginning of this bridge. Like, you gotta like, love the shit for a while.

### Full Transcript:

How would that go over at home with mama? No, we didn't have that in our prenup. Yeah, I can go off one week a year in perpetuity with my old girlfriend. Why would she agree to that? Money. Melinda Gates, when you read their story, she was acting like she met him in the parking lot and didn't know who he was. And she worked at Microsoft. I mean, no, no, I don't believe you, Melinda.

## Example 10: "Are You Allowing Yourself To Be Ignorant Again? | ..."

**Channel:** modern_wisdom | **Score:** 75.3 | **Views:** 41,979
**Pattern Used:** STORY OPENER

### Hook (First 3 seconds):
> We regularly have to start all over again. It's that old adage, Socrates was asked

### Full Transcript:
```
We regularly have to start all over again. It's that old adage, Socrates was asked why he was so wise and he was said that he was so wise because he knew that he wasn't wise. In other words, ignorance, a capacity to acknowledge one's ignorance is at the root cause of sophisticated thinking that you should be returning to a kind of basic ignorance. Remember the story of Picasso who went to an art school in old age and he looks at some children scribbling and doing drawings and he said, when I was their age, I could paint like Raphael and now I'm learning again how to paint like them. That's really a story about giving up the old map and allowing oneself to be ignorant again. That's a true gift we give to ourselves when we allow ourselves to say, you know what, I don't know very much at all. People say to me, oh, you must know so much about love or death or this or that. And I rush to tell them I literally don't know anything. This is not false modesty. It's genuine sense that with every passing day, I know less.
