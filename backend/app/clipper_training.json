Remember the story of Picasso who went to an art school in old age and he looks at some children scribbling and doing drawings and he said, when I was their age, I could paint like Raphael and now I'm learning again how to paint like them. That's really a story about giving up the old map and allowing oneself to be ignorant again. That's a true gift we give to ourselves when we allow ourselves to say, you know what, I don't know very much at all. People say to me, oh, you must know so much about love or death or this or that.

So the sum of the parts is greater than it is individually. I think in life you want to be finding people that believe in you more than you believe in you, that hold you to higher standards. I think that's the definition of a good friend. I think that's the definition of a good partner. Definition of a good husband, wife. They remind us of the best of ourselves.",

Which I thought this was so good and so helpful that for a man, yes, it's good if you can work on being funny because women do like it. But if you're a woman, you actually don't have to be that funny. You just have to be willing to laugh. And that brings me back to liking. Being an easy laugher, like being ready to laugh is one of the most likable complimentary things you can do for someone else. There's sometimes people will like withhold their laughing or like, they'll be like, oh, that's funny, right? So being an easy laugher is also like the fastest way to tell someone I like you.",

I always freeze because you need one good egg and you don't know if you're gonna get it or not, but freeze. And PCOS patients, the beauty of it is they have all these follicles so we can pull out a lot of eggs. Now the quality might not be good, but keep pulling it. So for my PCOS patients, generally speaking, I always tell my patients freeze 20 eggs because 20 is safe. But as you get older, especially if you have PCOS, I might want 40 eggs. You know, the more you have, because I know the quality is not that good.",

Find someone who you can communicate with each morning, just a good morning text. Seriously, this is one of the most powerful things you can do to check in with another member of your species each morning. You don't have to have conversation. You don't have to talk about what you're going to do each day.

Daycare raises salivary cortisol levels in children, the studies show, meaning those babies are put into stressful states at a very young age when their brains are developing. Daycare has been known to increase aggression and anxiety and behavioral problems in the school years. And those children are more likely to develop attachment disorders. Remember, those first three years when children are so very fragile and vulnerable, taking them away from your body as a primary attachment figure and handing them over to strangers and leaving them there for hours on end will cause your child to have to develop pathological defenses.

You're taking up the glucose. You're using it. It's a whole different physiology than sitting on the couch after a meal. That's very high impact. It's high leverage if it's after a meal.

That's the first noble truth of Buddhism. There is suffering in this life. Pay attention to your suffering without fighting it. Allow it to be there. I did this meditation. If something's physically painful or emotionally painful, I used to say, let go, let go to myself. Didn't work. So one day I said, all right, you can stay. Let it stay. And so I do a let stay meditation. If there's pain, let it stay. If there's sorrow, let it stay. And as soon as I let it stay, it begins to change. So first step is suffering. Second step is compassionate attention to one's suffering with no resistance. And the third step is to follow the compassion that is naturally being directed toward that suffering until you find yourself centered in it. And that is a huge relief.
