  "faq": [
    {"question": "Is 360 video worth the hassle?", "answer": "For solo creators, absolutely. Film once, choose angles later. Invisible selfie stick shots are impossible with traditional cameras. Learning curve pays off."},
    {"question": "Which has better image quality?", "answer": "GoPro slightly sharper in traditional mode. Insta360 360° video loses some resolution when cropped. Both look great on YouTube."},
    {"question": "Can I use both together?", "answer": "Yes. Many creators use GoPro for primary POV, Insta360 for creative angles. Best of both worlds if budget allows."},
    {"question": "Which is better for vlogging?", "answer": "Insta360 for solo travel vlogs (third-person shots). GoPro for action POV and simplicity. Depends on your style."}
