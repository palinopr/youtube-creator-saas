  "faq": [
    {"question": "Which is better for solo creators?", "answer": "Either works. Obsidian if you value speed and privacy. Notion if you want visual organization and might add team members later."},
    {"question": "Can I use both?", "answer": "Yes. Some use Obsidian for research/writing and Notion for project management/publishing calendar. Find what works for you."},
    {"question": "What about content calendars?", "answer": "Notion's calendar database is excellent. Obsidian needs plugins. For visual scheduling, Notion is easier."},
    {"question": "Is the learning curve worth it?", "answer": "Yes for both. Time invested pays off in organization. Neither requires complex setup to start—grow as needed."}
