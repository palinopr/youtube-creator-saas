  "faq": [
    {"question": "Is the quality difference noticeable?", "answer": "Yes, especially in depth of field and low light. Mirrorless looks more 'cinematic'. But good webcams are surprisingly capable."},
    {"question": "Can I use mirrorless as webcam?", "answer": "Yes, but needs capture card (Elgato Cam Link) or camera with native USB webcam mode. Some newer cameras support this."},
    {"question": "Best budget option?", "answer": "Logitech C920 or C922 for webcam. Sony ZV-E10 for mirrorless entry point. Both excellent for their category."},
    {"question": "Does my audience care?", "answer": "Content matters more than quality past a threshold. But professional appearance builds trust. Depends on your niche and audience."}
