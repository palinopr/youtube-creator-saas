  "faq": [
    {"question": "Can Canva thumbnails look professional?", "answer": "Absolutely. Many successful YouTubers use Canva exclusively. The key is customizing templates rather than using them as-is, and developing a consistent brand style."},
    {"question": "Is Photoshop overkill for YouTube thumbnails?", "answer": "For most creators, yes. Photoshop's power is rarely needed for thumbnails. However, if you're already proficient or want to develop design skills, it's an excellent choice."},
    {"question": "What's the best free option for thumbnails?", "answer": "Canva's free tier is extremely capable for thumbnails. You can also try GIMP (Photoshop alternative) or Photopea (browser-based Photoshop clone) for free."},
    {"question": "Do thumbnail tools affect SEO?", "answer": "The tool doesn't affect SEO directly, but thumbnail quality heavily impacts CTR, which influences how YouTube ranks and recommends your videos."}
