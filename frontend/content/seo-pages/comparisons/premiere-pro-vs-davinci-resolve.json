  "faq": [
    {"question": "Is DaVinci Resolve really free?", "answer": "Yes, the free version is genuinely free with no time limits or watermarks. The paid Studio version ($295 one-time) adds some advanced features, but most YouTubers never need them."},
    {"question": "Which editor is easier to learn?", "answer": "Premiere Pro has a gentler learning curve, especially if you've used other Adobe products. DaVinci Resolve's interface can be overwhelming initially but becomes intuitive with practice."},
    {"question": "Can my computer run DaVinci Resolve?", "answer": "Resolve benefits from a dedicated GPU more than Premiere. If you have a modern graphics card, Resolve actually performs better. On older hardware, Premiere may run smoother."},
    {"question": "Do professional YouTubers use free editors?", "answer": "Many successful creators use DaVinci Resolve's free version. The quality of your storytelling matters far more than which software you use."}
