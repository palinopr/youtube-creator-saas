  "faq": [
    {"question": "Is Final Cut Pro worth the $299?", "answer": "If you edit regularly on Mac, absolutely. The one-time cost equals about 13 months of Premiere. After that, it's free forever. Most active YouTubers recoup the cost quickly."},
    {"question": "Which has better performance?", "answer": "On Apple Silicon Macs, Final Cut Pro generally performs better with 4K/8K footage due to deep optimization. On Intel Macs or Windows, Premiere is comparable or better."},
    {"question": "Can I switch between them?", "answer": "Moving projects between FCP and Premiere requires conversion and some effects won't transfer perfectly. Pick one and stick with it for your main workflow."},
    {"question": "What do most YouTubers use?", "answer": "Both are popular. Premiere has larger market share overall, but many Mac-based YouTubers prefer Final Cut for its performance and one-time pricing."}
