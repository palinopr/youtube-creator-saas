    {"question": "Should I just get a better camera?", "answer": "If budget allows, dedicated cameras beat webcams. But for starting out or face cams, both Logitechs are solid choices."},
    {"question": "Do the built-in mics work well?", "answer": "Acceptable for basic use. Dedicated microphones sound much better. Use the webcam mic as backup only."},
    {"question": "Is the background replacement any good?", "answer": "Works okay with good lighting. Not as clean as actual green screen. Useful in a pinch but has visible edges."}
