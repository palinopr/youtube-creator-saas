  "faq": [
    {"question": "Which is better for YouTube?", "answer": "Depends on your room. Condenser in quiet, treated space. Dynamic in noisy or untreated room. Both can sound great."},
    {"question": "Why does SM7B sound good in untreated rooms?", "answer": "It's dynamic—naturally rejects room sound. Plus cardioid pattern focuses on voice. That's why podcasters love it."},
    {"question": "Can I use condenser in untreated room?", "answer": "Yes, but you'll hear more room. Use close-mic technique, add panels, or embrace it. Dynamic is easier solution."},
    {"question": "Popular options for each?", "answer": "Condenser: Rode NT1, Audio-Technica AT2020. Dynamic: Shure SM7B, Rode PodMic, Shure MV7."}
