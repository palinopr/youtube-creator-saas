  "faq": [
    {"question": "Which sounds better?", "answer": "The Rode NT-USB has a slightly warmer, more refined sound. The Yeti is good but can sound a bit harsh. For pure audio quality, Rode edges ahead."},
    {"question": "Is the Yeti's size a problem?", "answer": "It's large and can dominate desk space or appear prominent on camera. If aesthetics or space matter, consider the more compact Rode."},
    {"question": "Do I need multiple polar patterns?", "answer": "Most YouTubers only use cardioid. Multiple patterns help for interviews (bidirectional) or ambient recording (omnidirectional). If you're unsure, cardioid-only is fine."},
    {"question": "What about the Rode NT-USB Mini?", "answer": "The NT-USB Mini is smaller and cheaper than the full NT-USB. Sound quality is close. Consider it if desk space is limited."}
