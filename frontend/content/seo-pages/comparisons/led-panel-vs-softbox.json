  "faq": [
    {"question": "Which produces better light?", "answer": "Both can produce excellent light. Large softboxes often edge out small LED panels for softness. Quality LED panels match softbox quality."},
    {"question": "Are cheap LED panels worth it?", "answer": "Hit or miss. Cheap LEDs may flicker on camera or have poor color accuracy (low CRI). Spend enough to get 95+ CRI."},
    {"question": "Can I add softbox to LED panel?", "answer": "Yes! Many LED panels accept softbox attachments. Combines LED benefits with softbox diffusion. Best of both worlds."},
    {"question": "What about ring lights?", "answer": "Ring lights are LED-based. Great for front-facing work. Softboxes and panels offer more versatility for varied setups."}
