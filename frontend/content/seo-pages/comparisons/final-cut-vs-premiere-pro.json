  "faq": [
    {"question": "Is Final Cut Pro really faster on Mac?", "answer": "Yes, especially on Apple Silicon. Final Cut is built from the ground up for Mac hardware. The difference in 4K and 8K editing is significant."},
    {"question": "Which is easier to learn?", "answer": "Both have learning curves. Final Cut's magnetic timeline is different from traditional editing. Premiere follows conventional NLE patterns."},
    {"question": "Can I try before buying?", "answer": "Yes. Final Cut has a 90-day free trial. Premiere has a 7-day trial. Use both before deciding."},
    {"question": "What about iMovie users?", "answer": "Final Cut is the natural upgrade from iMovie. Many concepts transfer. Premiere will feel more different but offers more power."}
