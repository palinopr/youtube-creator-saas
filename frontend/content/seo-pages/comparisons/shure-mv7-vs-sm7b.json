  "faq": [
    {"question": "Can you hear the difference?", "answer": "Subtle. SM7B slightly warmer, smoother. MV7 a bit brighter. Both sound excellent. Most YouTube listeners won't notice difference."},
    {"question": "Does SM7B need a cloudlifter?", "answer": "Often, yes. SM7B has low output. Many interfaces struggle. Cloudlifter or Fethead ($100) helps. Some modern interfaces have enough gain."},
    {"question": "Total cost comparison?", "answer": "MV7: $250 standalone. SM7B: $400 + interface ($100-300) + possibly cloudlifter ($100) + XLR cable ($20). SM7B setup: $500-800 total."},
    {"question": "Which sounds more professional?", "answer": "Both sound professional. SM7B has more prestige in industry. MV7 is essentially SM7B DNA in modern package. Either works for YouTube."}
