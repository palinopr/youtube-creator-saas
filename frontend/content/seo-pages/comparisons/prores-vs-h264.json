  "faq": [
    {"question": "Should I record in ProRes?", "answer": "If camera supports it and storage permits, yes—best quality. Most cameras don't offer it. Use highest quality your camera provides."},
    {"question": "What about H.265/HEVC?", "answer": "Better compression than H.264 but harder to edit. Good for final delivery if YouTube supports it. ProRes still better for editing."},
    {"question": "Does YouTube prefer ProRes uploads?", "answer": "YouTube accepts both but recommends H.264. ProRes won't look better—YouTube re-encodes everything. H.264 uploads faster."},
    {"question": "My computer struggles with H.264 editing?", "answer": "Create proxy files. Edit with proxies, link to originals for export. Or transcode to ProRes/DNxHR for editing."}
