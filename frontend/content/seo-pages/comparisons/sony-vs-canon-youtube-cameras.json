  "faq": [
    {"question": "Which has better autofocus for vlogging?", "answer": "Both are excellent for vlogging. Canon's face/eye tracking is slightly more intuitive. Sony's is slightly faster. You can't go wrong with either for solo content."},
    {"question": "Is full-frame necessary for YouTube?", "answer": "No. APS-C cameras like Sony ZV-E10 or Canon R50 are excellent for YouTube. Full-frame helps with low light and depth of field but isn't required."},
    {"question": "What about lens costs?", "answer": "Both systems have affordable and expensive options. Sony E-mount has more third-party lenses. Canon RF is growing quickly. Budget for at least one good lens."},
    {"question": "Can I start with a cheaper model?", "answer": "Absolutely. The Sony ZV-E10 and Canon R50 are excellent starting points. Upgrade when you understand what features you actually need."}
