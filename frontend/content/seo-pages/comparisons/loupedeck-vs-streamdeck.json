  "faq": [
    {"question": "Which is better for video editing?", "answer": "Loupedeck's dials shine for editing—timeline scrubbing, color grading, audio levels. Stream Deck works but button-only limits precision."},
    {"question": "Can Stream Deck do what Loupedeck does?", "answer": "Some things. Stream Deck+ has dials now. But Loupedeck's editing integrations are deeper. Different strengths."},
    {"question": "Is Loupedeck worth the price?", "answer": "For heavy editors, yes. Time savings compound. For occasional editing or mainly streaming, Stream Deck is better value."},
    {"question": "Can I use both?", "answer": "Yes. Some have Stream Deck for streaming and Loupedeck for editing. Different tools for different workflows."}
