  "faq": [
    {"question": "Which is better for YouTube specifically?", "answer": "Both work great with YouTube. StreamYard edges out for guest shows. Restream wins for simulcasting to YouTube plus many other platforms."},
    {"question": "Can I use OBS with these platforms?", "answer": "Both support RTMP, so yes. But if you're using OBS anyway, you might not need either—OBS can multistream directly with plugins."},
    {"question": "Do they affect stream quality?", "answer": "Both re-encode your stream, which can slightly reduce quality. For most YouTube content, it's not noticeable. Direct encoding is slightly better."},
    {"question": "Which has better free tier?", "answer": "Depends on needs. StreamYard free includes watermark but full features. Restream free has multistreaming but limited features. Try both."}
