  "faq": [
    {"question": "Which sounds better for voice?", "answer": "Subjective. Volt's vintage mode flatters most voices immediately. Scarlett is neutral—add warmth in post. Both excellent. Different approaches."},
    {"question": "Are they reliable?", "answer": "Both very reliable. Scarlett has longer track record, massive user base. Volt is newer but UA has excellent reputation."},
    {"question": "Do I need 2i2 or Solo?", "answer": "Solo (1 input) is fine for single mic. 2i2 (2 inputs) useful for interviews, future flexibility. Price difference small—consider 2i2."},
    {"question": "What about latency?", "answer": "Both have excellent low-latency performance. Suitable for real-time monitoring. No significant difference for YouTube use."}
