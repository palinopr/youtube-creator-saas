  "faq": [
    {"question": "Which has better audio quality?", "answer": "Very similar for voice recording. Blue Yeti slightly warmer, Seiren slightly crisper. Both are quality USB mics."},
    {"question": "Are USB mics good enough for YouTube?", "answer": "Yes. Most viewers won't notice difference vs XLR. Focus on technique (distance, room treatment) over mic upgrades."},
    {"question": "Do these pick up keyboard noise?", "answer": "Yes, both do. They're condenser mics. Use boom arm to position closer to mouth, or switch to dynamic mic for noisy rooms."},
    {"question": "Which is better for streaming?", "answer": "Blue Yeti's mute button and monitoring are convenient for streams. Razer's software integrates with other Razer gear. Both work fine."}
