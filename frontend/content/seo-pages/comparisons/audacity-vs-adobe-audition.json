    {"question": "Can Audacity match Audition for YouTube?", "answer": "For basic voice editing, yes. Noise reduction is good enough for most. Where Audition shines is complex restoration and workflow integration."},

    {"question": "Can I do voice-over work with Audacity?", "answer": "Yes. Many professionals use Audacity for voice work. Add VST plugins for more control. Results depend on recording quality."}
