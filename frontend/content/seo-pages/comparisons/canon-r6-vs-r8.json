    {"question": "Is IBIS worth the extra cost?", "answer": "For handheld video, absolutely. Game-changing for vlogging, walking shots. If you use tripod/gimbal primarily, less essential."},
    {"question": "Same image quality?", "answer": "Very similar. Same sensor and processor family. R8 is not a downgrade in image output—just fewer features."},
    {"question": "Best for YouTube beginners?", "answer": "R8 offers incredible value. Use savings for quality lens (like RF 35mm 1.8). Can upgrade body later."},
    {"question": "R6 vs R6 II worth the difference?", "answer": "R6 II has improved autofocus and video features. R6 (original) often found at discount. Both excellent for YouTube."}
