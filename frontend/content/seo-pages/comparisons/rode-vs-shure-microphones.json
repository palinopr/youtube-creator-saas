  "faq": [
    {"question": "Is the Shure SM7B worth the price?", "answer": "For the right use case, yes. It's broadcast-quality and rejects room noise exceptionally. But for many YouTubers, a Rode PodMic at 1/4 the price delivers 90% of the quality."},
    {"question": "Do I need an audio interface?", "answer": "XLR mics (SM7B, PodMic) need an interface. USB mics (Rode NT-USB, Shure MV7 USB mode) plug directly into your computer."},
    {"question": "Which is better for noisy rooms?", "answer": "Dynamic mics like SM7B and PodMic reject more room noise than condenser mics. Both brands offer good options for untreated rooms."},
    {"question": "Can I start cheap and upgrade later?", "answer": "Absolutely. Start with a Rode NT-USB Mini or similar, then upgrade to XLR when you're ready. Your audio skills matter more than gear at first."}
