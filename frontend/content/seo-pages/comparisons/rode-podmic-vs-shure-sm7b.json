  "faq": [
    {"question": "Is the SM7B really worth 4x the price?", "answer": "For most podcasters, probably not. The PodMic gets you 85-90% of the quality. The SM7B excels in difficult recording environments and for its legendary status."},
    {"question": "Does the SM7B need a Cloudlifter?", "answer": "Often yes. It requires significant gain. A Cloudlifter or FetHead helps, adding ~$100-150 to the cost. Some interfaces have enough gain built-in."},
    {"question": "Which is better for untreated rooms?", "answer": "Both are good due to dynamic design. SM7B has slightly better background rejection. But neither replaces proper acoustic treatment."},
    {"question": "Can I use these with a basic USB interface?", "answer": "PodMic works with most interfaces. SM7B may need an interface with high gain or a preamp like Cloudlifter. Check your interface's gain specs."}
