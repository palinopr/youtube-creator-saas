  "faq": [
    {"question": "Which is better for YouTube?", "answer": "Cardioid for most YouTubers. Better noise rejection, focused on single speaker. Omni only for specific multi-person situations."},
    {"question": "What about lavalier mics?", "answer": "Lavs come in both patterns. Omni lavs are common (more forgiving), but cardioid lavs exist for noisy environments."},
    {"question": "Can I switch patterns?", "answer": "Some mics have switchable patterns (multi-pattern). Blue Yeti, high-end condensers offer multiple pickup options."},
    {"question": "Does pattern affect sound quality?", "answer": "Not quality—character. Cardioid has proximity effect (bass boost close up). Omni sounds more natural and open."}
