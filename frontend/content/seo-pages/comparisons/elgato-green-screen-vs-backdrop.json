  "faq": [
    {"question": "Is Elgato worth the premium?", "answer": "If you stream/record frequently and value convenience, yes. The time saved and wrinkle-free surface justify cost for regular users."},
    {"question": "Does cheap green screen work?", "answer": "Yes, with proper lighting and wrinkle management. Fabric works fine if you steam it and light it evenly."},
    {"question": "What about painted walls?", "answer": "Best option if permanent setup possible. Chroma key paint gives perfect surface. But can't be hidden."},
    {"question": "Lighting requirements different?", "answer": "Same for both—even lighting on background, separate lighting on subject. Screen type doesn't change lighting needs."}
