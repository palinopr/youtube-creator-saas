  "faq": [
    {"question": "Can Descript replace Premiere?", "answer": "For some creators, yes. Podcast, tutorials, and talking-head content edit faster in Descript. Not for music videos, films, or effects-heavy work."},
    {"question": "Is text-based editing actually good?", "answer": "Game-changing for speech-heavy content. Find and delete tangents instantly. Remove filler words in one click. It's genuinely faster."},
    {"question": "What about video quality?", "answer": "Both export high-quality video. Descript's export options are simpler. Premiere offers more compression control."},
    {"question": "Can I use both?", "answer": "Yes. Some use Descript for rough cut (fast transcript editing) then Premiere for polish. The workflow can complement."}
