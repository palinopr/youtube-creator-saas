  "faq": [
    {"question": "Can I switch from Streamlabs to OBS?", "answer": "Yes, you can export Streamlabs scenes to OBS. However, Streamlabs-specific widgets won't transfer and will need to be replaced with OBS plugins or browser sources."},
    {"question": "Which has better stream quality?", "answer": "Both can achieve identical stream quality since they use the same encoding technology. The difference is in features and resource usage, not output quality."},
    {"question": "Is Streamlabs really just OBS with extras?", "answer": "Streamlabs was originally built on OBS but has diverged significantly. It adds proprietary features while OBS remains purely open-source with community plugins."},
    {"question": "What about Streamlabs Ultra subscription?", "answer": "Streamlabs Ultra ($19/month) removes branding, adds premium themes, and includes extras. Most streamers don't need it - the free version is fully functional."}
