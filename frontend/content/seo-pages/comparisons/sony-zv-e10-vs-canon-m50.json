  "faq": [
    {"question": "Which has better autofocus?", "answer": "ZV-E10 has superior video autofocus with real-time eye tracking. M50's Dual Pixel is good but not as sticky in video mode."},
    {"question": "Is the 4K crop on M50 a problem?", "answer": "Yes, significant crop makes 4K less useful. Most M50 users shoot 1080p. ZV-E10's 4K has smaller crop."},
    {"question": "Which is better for beginners?", "answer": "M50 is more beginner-friendly with more learning resources. ZV-E10 is simple too but more video-focused."},
    {"question": "Audio quality difference?", "answer": "ZV-E10's built-in mic is better. Both support external mics—use one for best results regardless."}
