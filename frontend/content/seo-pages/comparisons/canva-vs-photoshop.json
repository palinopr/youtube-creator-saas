    {"question": "Can Canva match Photoshop quality?", "answer": "For most YouTube thumbnails, yes. Canva's output is high quality. Photoshop shines for complex compositing and photo manipulation that Canva can't do."},
    {"question": "Should I learn Photoshop or just use Canva?", "answer": "Start with Canva for quick results. Learn Photoshop if you hit Canva's limitations or want professional design skills. Many creators use both."},
    {"question": "Is Canva Pro worth it?", "answer": "For YouTube creators, often yes. Background remover, Brand Kit, and premium templates save significant time. The free version works fine for starting out."},
    {"question": "What about Figma?", "answer": "Figma is a great middle ground - more powerful than Canva, free, and easier than Photoshop. Worth considering for design-focused creators."}
