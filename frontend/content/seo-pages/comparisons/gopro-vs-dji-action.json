  "faq": [
    {"question": "Which has better stabilization?", "answer": "Both are excellent. GoPro's HyperSmooth is slightly smoother in extreme conditions. DJI's RockSteady is comparable for most action footage."},
    {"question": "Which is better for vlogging?", "answer": "DJI's front-facing screen and modular design make it slightly better for vlogging. GoPro requires accessories for front-facing preview."},
    {"question": "Do I need 5.3K resolution?", "answer": "Not usually. 4K is plenty for YouTube. 5.3K helps with cropping and stabilization. Don't choose based on resolution alone."},
    {"question": "What about battery life?", "answer": "Both have limited battery life during heavy use. Plan for multiple batteries. DJI's modular battery helps, GoPro has swappable batteries."}
