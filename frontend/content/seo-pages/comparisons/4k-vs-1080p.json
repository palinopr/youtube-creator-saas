  "faq": [
    {"question": "Does YouTube compress 4K anyway?", "answer": "Yes, but 4K gets higher bitrate allocation. Looks slightly better on capable devices. Difference subtle on mobile."},
    {"question": "Should I record 4K even if exporting 1080p?", "answer": "Good strategy if computer handles it. 4K source downsampled to 1080p looks excellent. Plus reframing flexibility."},
    {"question": "Do viewers care about 4K?", "answer": "Most don't notice or select it. Mobile viewers rarely choose 4K. Big screen viewers appreciate it. Content matters more."},
    {"question": "What about 1440p?", "answer": "Good middle ground. Better bitrate than 1080p, less demanding than 4K. YouTube treats it well. Solid compromise."}
