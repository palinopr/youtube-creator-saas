    {"question": "Which sounds better?", "answer": "Very similar sound quality—both are excellent broadcast dynamics. MV7 slightly warmer, PodMic slightly brighter. Differences are subtle."},
    {"question": "Do I need an interface for PodMic?", "answer": "Yes, PodMic is XLR-only. Need audio interface (Focusrite Scarlett, etc.) or mixer. Add ~$100 minimum."},
    {"question": "Is MV7 worth double the price?", "answer": "If you need USB flexibility or don't have an interface, yes. If you have interface, PodMic is better value for sound alone."},
    {"question": "Which is better for YouTube?", "answer": "Both excellent. PodMic + interface for best value/quality. MV7 for simplicity and flexibility."}
