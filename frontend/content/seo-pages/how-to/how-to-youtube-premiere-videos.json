    {"question": "When should I premiere vs regular upload?", "answer": "Premiere special content—big productions, important announcements, milestone videos. Regular uploads for frequent content. Don't premiere everything or it loses impact."},
    {"question": "How far ahead should I schedule premiere?", "answer": "24-72 hours gives time to promote. Longer for major content. Short notice works for spontaneous community events. Test what works for your audience."},
    {"question": "Should I be present during premiere?", "answer": "Ideally yes—engage in live chat. Increases retention and community connection. If you can't, pin a comment explaining. Have moderators if possible."},
    {"question": "Can I edit video after scheduling premiere?", "answer": "Can edit title, description, tags before premiere. Cannot replace video file. If major issue found, cancel premiere and reschedule with correct video."}
