  "faq": [
    {"question": "How much can I earn per 1,000 views?", "answer": "RPM (revenue per 1000 views) varies widely: $1-5 for entertainment, $5-15 for business/finance, $20+ for some niches. Depends on audience location and advertiser demand."},
    {"question": "When should I start doing sponsorships?", "answer": "When brands reach out or when you have 5,000+ engaged subscribers. Micro-influencers often get better rates relative to size. Don't wait until you're 'big.'"},
    {"question": "Is affiliate marketing worth it?", "answer": "Yes, especially for review and tutorial content. Amazon pays 1-10% depending on category. Specialty affiliates often pay more. Disclose all affiliate links."},
    {"question": "How do I price sponsorships?", "answer": "General rule: $20-50 per 1,000 subscribers for dedicated videos, less for integrations. But negotiate based on your engagement rate and niche value."}
