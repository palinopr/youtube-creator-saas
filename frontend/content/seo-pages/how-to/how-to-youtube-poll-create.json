  "faq": [
    {"question": "How many subscribers needed for polls?", "answer": "500 subscribers minimum to access Community tab and post polls. This threshold was lowered from 1,000. Once unlocked, polls are a powerful engagement tool."},
    {"question": "How often should I post polls?", "answer": "Weekly or bi-weekly works well. Don't spam—quality over quantity. Space between video uploads. Too many polls fatigue your audience."},
    {"question": "Can I see who voted?", "answer": "No—poll responses are anonymous. You see total numbers and percentages only. This encourages honest participation without social pressure."},
    {"question": "Do polls help the algorithm?", "answer": "Indirectly—engagement signals show active community. Polls keep your channel visible in feeds between uploads. Algorithm likes channels that maintain audience connection."}
