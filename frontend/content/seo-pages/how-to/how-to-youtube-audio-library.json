  "faq": [
    {"question": "Will I get copyright claims using Audio Library?", "answer": "No—tracks are specifically cleared for YouTube use. That's the whole point. Some tracks require attribution in description, but no monetization claims. Completely safe to use."},
    {"question": "Is the music good quality?", "answer": "Quality varies—some excellent, some basic. More tracks added regularly. For premium quality, paid services (Epidemic Sound, Artlist) offer more selection. But Audio Library is solid for free."},
    {"question": "Can I use on other platforms?", "answer": "Check each track's license. YouTube Audio Library is designed for YouTube, but many tracks are usable elsewhere. Some may have platform restrictions. When in doubt, use only on YouTube."},
    {"question": "How often is new music added?", "answer": "Regularly—YouTube continuously adds tracks. Check back periodically for fresh options. Star favorites so you don't lose them. Build a personal library of go-to tracks."}
