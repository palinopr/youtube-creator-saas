  "faq": [
    {"question": "How much does YouTube take from memberships?", "answer": "YouTube takes 30% of membership revenue. You keep 70%. So a $4.99 membership nets you about $3.49."},
    {"question": "What should I price tiers at?", "answer": "Common tiers: $0.99 (entry), $4.99 (standard), $9.99+ (premium). Match perks to price. Don't overpromise."},
    {"question": "How do I get members to join?", "answer": "Remind viewers in videos, create compelling perks, show member benefits, celebrate members publicly. Consistency matters more than promotion."},
    {"question": "What if I can't deliver perks?", "answer": "Start simple. Custom emoji and badges require no extra work. Add members-only content as you can sustain it. Don't burn out."}
