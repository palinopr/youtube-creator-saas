    {"question": "How much text on thumbnails?", "answer": "Less is more. 3-4 words maximum. Large, bold, readable at small sizes. Text should add context, not repeat title."},
    {"question": "Should I use my face?", "answer": "Faces with emotion typically perform better—humans are wired to notice faces. Not required for all niches, but strong performer for personality-driven channels."}
