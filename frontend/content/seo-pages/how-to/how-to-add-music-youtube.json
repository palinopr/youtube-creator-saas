  "faq": [
    {"question": "Can I use any song with credit?", "answer": "No. Giving credit doesn't grant license. You need actual permission or license. Most popular songs will result in claims regardless of credit."},
    {"question": "What about copyright-free YouTube channels?", "answer": "Some are legitimate, some aren't. Verify license terms. NoCopyrightSounds, Audio Library are generally safe. Always check."},
    {"question": "What happens if I get a claim?", "answer": "Content ID claim usually means revenue goes to rights holder. Strike is more serious—affects channel standing. Dispute only if you have rights."},
    {"question": "Is YouTube Audio Library good enough?", "answer": "For many creators, yes. Quality varies but good tracks available. Free and guaranteed safe. Paid services offer more variety and quality."}
