  "faq": [
    {"question": "Should I disable comments?", "answer": "Almost never—comments drive engagement signals. Even controversial topics can have moderated discussions. Disable only for specific sensitive videos, not channel-wide. YouTube may also limit features on channels with disabled comments."},
    {"question": "How to handle negative comments?", "answer": "Legitimate criticism: respond thoughtfully or ignore. Trolls: delete and/or block, don't engage. Spam: delete. Hate speech: report and delete. Your comment section, your rules. Don't let negativity consume you."},
    {"question": "When to add moderators?", "answer": "When you can't keep up with comments yourself. Trusted community members who understand your values. Start with one, add as needed. Give clear guidelines. Review their actions occasionally."},
    {"question": "Do comments affect the algorithm?", "answer": "Yes—engagement signals include comments. Videos with discussion perform better. Quality of engagement matters too. Building genuine community helps more than comment count alone."}
