  "faq": [
    {"question": "How many videos should I batch?", "answer": "Start with 3-4. Work up to 6-8 with practice. Quality drops if you push too hard. Find your sustainable maximum."},
    {"question": "How do I maintain energy across recordings?", "answer": "Take real breaks. Eat snacks. Stand up and move. Record hardest videos when energy is highest. Don't schedule too many."},
    {"question": "Won't my content feel dated?", "answer": "For evergreen content, no problem. For timely content, record closer to upload. Many creators batch evergreen and record timely content separately."},
    {"question": "How do I organize batch recorded footage?", "answer": "Clear file naming immediately. Create folders per video. Add notes about each recording. Organization prevents editing headaches."}
