    {"question": "Can I pin multiple comments?", "answer": "No—only one pinned comment per video at a time. Pinning new comment unpins previous. Choose strategically or rotate over time."},
    {"question": "Does pinning notify the commenter?", "answer": "Yes—they receive notification that their comment was pinned. Great for community building. Makes viewers feel valued."},
    {"question": "Should I pin my own or viewer comments?", "answer": "Both work. Your own for questions, corrections, CTAs. Viewer comments for community building. Mix based on video needs."},
    {"question": "Can I edit pinned comments?", "answer": "Can edit your own pinned comment anytime. Can't edit viewer comments. If correction needed, consider pinning your own instead."}
