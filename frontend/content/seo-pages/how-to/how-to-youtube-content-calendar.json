  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best tool for content calendar?", "answer": "Notion for flexibility and customization. Trello for kanban-style workflow. Google Calendar for simplicity. Airtable for database features. Use what you'll actually maintain—best tool is one you use."},
    {"question": "How far ahead to plan?", "answer": "Minimum 4 weeks for consistent uploading. 8-12 weeks ideal for batching and stress reduction. Quarterly for major campaigns. Some successful creators plan 3-6 months ahead for major content."},
    {"question": "What if I want to post trending content?", "answer": "Build flexibility into calendar—don't fill every slot. 'Trending topic' placeholder can be recurring. Some creators have 80% planned, 20% reactive. Balance consistency with relevance."},
    {"question": "How to handle falling behind?", "answer": "Don't stress—adjust the calendar, not yourself. Move things rather than rushing. Reduce frequency temporarily if needed. Calendar serves you, not the other way around. Sustainable pace wins long-term."}
