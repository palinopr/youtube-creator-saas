  "faq": [
    {"question": "Do playlists help with YouTube algorithm?", "answer": "Yes—playlists increase session watch time through autoplay. More watch time signals quality content. Playlists also rank in search independently."},
    {"question": "How many playlists should I have?", "answer": "Create one for each distinct topic or series. Quality over quantity. Empty or sparse playlists look unprofessional. 5-15 well-organized playlists typical."},
    {"question": "Should I include other creators' videos?", "answer": "Can help viewers and build relationships, but prioritize your content for watch time. Mixed playlists can be useful for curated topic collections."},
    {"question": "Best video order for playlists?", "answer": "For series: chronological. For topics: best video first to hook viewers, then by relevance or recency. Test different orders."}
