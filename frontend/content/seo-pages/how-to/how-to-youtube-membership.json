    {"question": "What percentage does YouTube take?", "answer": "YouTube takes 30% of membership revenue. Plan pricing accordingly. Still better than most platforms."},
    {"question": "How many tiers should I have?", "answer": "Start with 2-3 tiers. Too many confuses people. Most members join lowest or second tier regardless of options."},
    {"question": "Best perks for retention?", "answer": "Community access (Discord) has highest retention. Early access is easy. Behind-the-scenes is popular. Avoid perks requiring individual attention at scale."},
    {"question": "How to promote memberships?", "answer": "Dedicated announcement video. Regular reminders in videos (not annoying). Shoutouts to members. Show member benefits in action."}
