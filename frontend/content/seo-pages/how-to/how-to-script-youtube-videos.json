  "faq": [
    {"question": "Should I read my script word-for-word?", "answer": "Depends on your style. Some creators memorize and deliver naturally. Others use teleprompters. Bullet-point outlines work for confident speakers. Find what sounds natural for you."},
    {"question": "How long should a script be?", "answer": "Roughly 150-180 words per minute of video. A 10-minute video is about 1,500-1,800 words. Adjust for your speaking pace and visual content that doesn't need narration."},
    {"question": "How do I make scripts sound natural?", "answer": "Write like you speak, not like you write. Use contractions. Short sentences. Read aloud while editing—if it sounds awkward, rewrite it."},
    {"question": "Do all videos need scripts?", "answer": "Not necessarily. Vlogs and casual content work unscripted. Educational, tutorial, and narrative content benefit greatly from scripting. At minimum, have an outline."}
