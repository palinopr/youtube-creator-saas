  "faq": [
    {"question": "Why don't I get notifications?", "answer": "Check bell setting on channel—might be 'Personalized' or 'None.' Check device notification settings. Check email spam folder. YouTube may not notify for every upload even with 'All' selected during high traffic."},
    {"question": "Do all subscribers get notified?", "answer": "No—even with bell, YouTube doesn't guarantee 100% delivery. 'Personalized' means YouTube decides. 'All' improves odds but isn't guaranteed. This is why creators ask viewers to hit the bell."},
    {"question": "How to reduce notification overload?", "answer": "Audit subscriptions—unsubscribe from inactive follows. Set most channels to 'Personalized' or 'None.' Reserve 'All' for top 5-10 creators. Use email digest instead of per-upload. Check notification settings monthly."},
    {"question": "Notifications for live streams?", "answer": "Live notifications are separate—YouTube often prioritizes these. Turn on for channels you want to catch live. Scheduled premieres also send notifications. Live notifications typically sent 5-10 minutes before start."}
