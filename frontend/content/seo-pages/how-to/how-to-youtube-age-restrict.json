    {"question": "Can I remove age restriction?", "answer": "If YouTube applied it, appeal through Studio. If you self-applied, edit video settings to remove. YouTube-applied restrictions require review—success not guaranteed."},
    {"question": "Does age restriction affect monetization?", "answer": "Significantly—many advertisers avoid restricted content. Revenue typically much lower. Some restricted content may not monetize at all. Consider if mature content is worth the trade-off."},
    {"question": "Why was my video age-restricted?", "answer": "YouTube's system or reviewer flagged mature content. Check email for specifics. Common triggers: violence, adult themes, language, dangerous activities. Context matters but doesn't guarantee exemption."},
    {"question": "Should I self-restrict borderline content?", "answer": "Sometimes strategic—protects channel from strikes. Shows good faith. However, limits reach significantly. Consider audience and content purpose. Alternative: edit content to avoid restriction entirely."}
