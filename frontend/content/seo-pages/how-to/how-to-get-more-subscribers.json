    {"question": "How many subscribers do I need to make money?", "answer": "The YouTube Partner Program requires 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 watch hours (or 10M Shorts views). But subscriber count alone doesn't determine income - views, watch time, and niche matter more."},
    {"question": "Why do I get views but not subscribers?", "answer": "Usually means your content is discoverable but doesn't promise ongoing value. Ask yourself: what would a viewer miss by not subscribing? Make that clear in your content."},
    {"question": "Is buying subscribers worth it?", "answer": "Never. Purchased subscribers don't watch your videos, which tanks your engagement metrics. YouTube can detect fake subscribers and may penalize your channel. It's a waste of money."},
    {"question": "How often should I ask people to subscribe?", "answer": "Quality over quantity. One well-placed, genuine CTA after you've delivered value is better than multiple desperate asks. The best subscribe requests explain WHY to subscribe."}
