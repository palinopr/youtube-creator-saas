  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long does review take?", "answer": "Usually 1-4 weeks after applying. YouTube reviews channel for policy compliance. Larger backlog sometimes causes delays."},
    {"question": "Why was I rejected?", "answer": "Common reasons: reused content, spam, misleading metadata, or insufficient original content. Address issues and reapply after 30 days."},
    {"question": "How much do YouTubers make?", "answer": "Varies enormously: $1-$25+ per 1000 views depending on niche, audience location, and ad types. Finance/business highest, entertainment lower."},
    {"question": "Can I lose monetization?", "answer": "Yes—community strikes, policy violations, or failing to maintain thresholds can result in demonetization. Stay compliant."}
