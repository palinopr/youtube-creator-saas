  "faq": [
    {"question": "What is a good CTR for YouTube?", "answer": "Average CTR is 2-10% depending on niche and audience. Returning subscribers have lower CTR since they click based on trust. Browse/suggested traffic typically has higher CTR. Aim to beat your own average."},
    {"question": "Why is my CTR dropping?", "answer": "CTR naturally drops as YouTube shows your video to broader audiences. Initial CTR from subscribers is high, but as impressions grow to non-subscribers, CTR typically decreases. This is normal and expected."},
    {"question": "Is high CTR always good?", "answer": "Not if it's clickbait. High CTR with low watch time hurts your channel. YouTube rewards videos where both CTR AND watch time are strong. Never sacrifice viewer satisfaction for clicks."},
    {"question": "How often should I change thumbnails?", "answer": "Give thumbnails at least a week before judging. If CTR is significantly below your average after 1000+ impressions, try a new version. Don't change constantly - give each version time to prove itself."}
