  "faq": [
    {"question": "What time should I schedule videos?", "answer": "Check YouTube Analytics > Audience > When your viewers are on YouTube. Generally, weekday afternoons work for most niches. Test and adjust based on data."},
    {"question": "Can I edit a scheduled video?", "answer": "Yes—everything editable until publish time. Title, description, thumbnail, visibility all changeable. Can also cancel schedule entirely."},
    {"question": "Does scheduling affect the algorithm?", "answer": "No direct impact. Algorithm cares about performance after publishing, not how it was published. Schedule vs immediate publish makes no difference."},
    {"question": "Should I use Premiere for scheduled videos?", "answer": "Optional. Premieres are good for building community—live chat during first watch. Regular scheduling is simpler. Use Premiere for special content."}
