  "faq": [
    {"question": "Do I need #Shorts in the title?", "answer": "Not required anymore but helps initially. YouTube now auto-detects vertical videos under 60 seconds. Including it doesn't hurt."},
    {"question": "Can Shorts be monetized?", "answer": "Yes. Shorts Fund pays creators. Also drives subscribers to your monetized long-form. Shorts increasingly part of RPM calculations."},
    {"question": "Best length for Shorts?", "answer": "15-45 seconds often performs best. Long enough to deliver value, short enough to rewatch. Under 60 seconds required."},
    {"question": "Should I repurpose TikToks?", "answer": "Yes, but remove TikTok watermark. YouTube may suppress watermarked content. Re-export from original or use editing app."}
