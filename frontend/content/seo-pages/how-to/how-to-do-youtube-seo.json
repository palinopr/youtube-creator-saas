  "faq": [
    {"question": "How important are tags for YouTube SEO?", "answer": "Less important than before. YouTube says tags have 'minimal' impact. Still worth using—put your primary keyword first, add 5-10 relevant variations."},
    {"question": "Does speaking keywords help SEO?", "answer": "Yes. YouTube transcribes audio and uses it for understanding content. Naturally mentioning your topic helps YouTube categorize your video."},
    {"question": "How long until SEO kicks in?", "answer": "Videos can rank immediately or take months. Initial performance often improves as YouTube learns more about your video's audience fit."},
    {"question": "Should I optimize old videos?", "answer": "Yes. Updating titles, thumbnails, and descriptions can revive underperforming videos. Monitor for improvements after changes."}
