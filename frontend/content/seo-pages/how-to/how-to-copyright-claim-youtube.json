  "faq": [
    {"question": "Does a claim hurt my channel?", "answer": "Content ID claims don't give strikes or limit your channel. They mainly affect that video's monetization. Takedowns are more serious."},
    {"question": "Should I dispute every claim?", "answer": "No. Only dispute if you legitimately have rights or clear fair use. False disputes can lead to strikes. Accept claims for content you don't own."},
    {"question": "What is fair use?", "answer": "Using copyrighted material for commentary, criticism, education, or parody. It's complex and context-dependent. Not just 'I credited them.'"},
    {"question": "How long do claims last?", "answer": "Depends on claimant policy. Some are permanent. Others release after a period. Check claim details for specifics."}
