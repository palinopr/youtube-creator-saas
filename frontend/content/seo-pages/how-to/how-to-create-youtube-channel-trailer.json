  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long should a channel trailer be?", "answer": "30-60 seconds is ideal. Maximum 90 seconds. Shorter trailers convert better. Say what you need to say efficiently."},
    {"question": "Should I script my trailer?", "answer": "Yes. Every second matters in a trailer. Script tightly, practice delivery, and edit ruthlessly. Don't ramble."},
    {"question": "How often should I update my trailer?", "answer": "When your content direction changes significantly or your trailer feels dated. Some creators update yearly, others keep the same trailer for years."},
    {"question": "Do channel trailers still matter?", "answer": "Yes. Auto-play catches attention. Many subscribers credit the trailer for their subscription. It's free real estate on your channel page."}
