  "faq": [
    {"question": "How many cards per video?", "answer": "YouTube allows up to 5 cards. But use only what's needed. 2-3 well-placed cards often outperform 5 random ones."},
    {"question": "Best timing for cards?", "answer": "When you mention related content verbally. Also before natural drop-off points. Don't cluster at the end."},
    {"question": "Cards vs end screens?", "answer": "Different purposes. Cards work throughout video for contextual links. End screens are for final CTA. Use both."},
    {"question": "Do cards hurt retention?", "answer": "Potentially—if they send viewers away. But keeping viewers on your channel overall is the goal. Strategic placement minimizes loss."}
