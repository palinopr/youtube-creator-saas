    {"question": "How long should the hook be?", "answer": "5-30 seconds typically. Get to value fast. The hook should flow into content, not be a separate intro."},
    {"question": "Should I tease the ending?", "answer": "Often yes—showing results first creates curiosity about how. 'Here's what I built/achieved... let me show you how.'"},
    {"question": "Can I greet viewers at all?", "answer": "Yes, but after the hook. Deliver value first, then briefly greet if it fits your style. Never lead with greetings."},
    {"question": "How to test hook effectiveness?", "answer": "Check retention graph at 30-second mark. High drop-off = weak hook. Compare across videos to find patterns."}
