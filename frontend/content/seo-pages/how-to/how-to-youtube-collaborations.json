  "faq": [
    {"question": "How to find collaboration partners?", "answer": "Look for creators with similar audience size and related (not identical) niche. Check who your audience also watches. Engage in creator communities. Be a genuine fan first—forced partnerships feel forced."},
    {"question": "What if they're bigger than me?", "answer": "Very large gap usually doesn't work—no mutual benefit. Exceptions: exceptional content proposal, existing relationship, or they genuinely like your work. Better to grow with similar-sized creators first."},
    {"question": "Best first collab format?", "answer": "Video swap is lowest commitment—you each make content for the other's channel. Tests compatibility before deeper collaboration. Joint videos require more trust and coordination. Start simple."},
    {"question": "How to maintain collab relationships?", "answer": "Stay in touch beyond collabs. Support their content genuinely. Refer opportunities their way. Don't only reach out when you want something. Build real relationships, not just promotional exchanges."}
