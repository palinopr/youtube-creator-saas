  "faq": [
    {"question": "Can I change my handle later?", "answer": "Yes, but limited—typically twice per 14 days. Old handle becomes available for others. Don't rely on changing frequently."},
    {"question": "What if my name is taken?", "answer": "Try variations: add 'official', 'hq', 'tv', or your niche. Underscores and periods can help. Or shorten creatively."},
    {"question": "Handle vs channel name?", "answer": "Different things. Channel name (display name) can be anything and isn't unique. Handle is your @ identifier and must be unique."},
    {"question": "Do handles affect SEO?", "answer": "Minor impact. Main benefit is brand recognition and easier discovery. Your content matters more than handle for SEO."}
