    {"question": "Phone photos good enough quality?", "answer": "Modern phones are excellent. Good lighting matters more than camera. iPhone and high-end Android produce professional results."},
    {"question": "How to get consistent thumbnail style?", "answer": "Create template in Canva. Save as 'Copy this design'. Same fonts, colors, layout positions. Swap photo and text each time."}
