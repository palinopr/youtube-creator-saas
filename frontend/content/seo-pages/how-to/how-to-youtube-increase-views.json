  "faq": [
    {"question": "Why aren't my videos getting views?", "answer": "Usually: not being shown (topic/SEO), not being clicked (thumbnail/title), or not being watched (content). Diagnose by checking impressions, CTR, and retention."},
    {"question": "How long to see view growth?", "answer": "Varies widely. Some videos perform immediately, others take months. Focus on consistent improvement. 50+ videos often needed for significant traction."},
    {"question": "Should I buy views?", "answer": "Absolutely not. Fake views destroy engagement metrics. YouTube can detect and penalize. Focus on genuine growth through good content."},
    {"question": "Do tags help get views?", "answer": "Minimal impact today. Title, description, and content matter much more. Do tags properly but don't obsess—bigger fish to fry."}
