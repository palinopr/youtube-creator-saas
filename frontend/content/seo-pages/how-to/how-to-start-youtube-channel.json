  "faq": [
    {"question": "How much does it cost to start a YouTube channel?", "answer": "Zero to start. Your phone is enough to begin. Invest in better gear only after you've validated your content idea and commitment."},
    {"question": "How long until I get monetized?", "answer": "Requirements: 1,000 subscribers + 4,000 watch hours (or 10M Shorts views). Timeline varies wildly - some achieve it in months, others take years. Focus on content, not milestones."},
    {"question": "Should I show my face?", "answer": "Not required. Many successful channels are faceless (tutorials, compilations, animations). But face-to-camera content often builds stronger audience connection."},
    {"question": "How often should I upload?", "answer": "Consistency matters more than frequency. Weekly is sustainable for most. Start with what you can maintain long-term."}
