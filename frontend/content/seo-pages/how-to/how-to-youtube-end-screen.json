  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long should end screens be?", "answer": "15-20 seconds is ideal. Long enough to give viewers time to click, not so long it feels padded. Minimum 5 seconds available."},
    {"question": "Best for viewer vs specific video?", "answer": "'Best for viewer' uses YouTube's algorithm to suggest personalized content. Often gets more clicks. Test against your specific video picks."},
    {"question": "Why can't I add end screens?", "answer": "Video must be at least 25 seconds long. Some videos with content restrictions may not allow end screens. Check Studio for specific issues."},
    {"question": "Do end screens affect watch time?", "answer": "They can decrease percentage watched (people click away early) but increase session time (they watch more videos). Net positive for channel."}
