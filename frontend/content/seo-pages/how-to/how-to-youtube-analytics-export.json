  "faq": [
    {"question": "What data can I export?", "answer": "Most analytics data exportable—views, watch time, subscribers, revenue (if monetized), traffic sources, demographics, and more. Advanced Mode reveals additional breakdowns. Some real-time data not available."},
    {"question": "Google Sheets or CSV?", "answer": "Google Sheets for immediate cloud access and collaboration. CSV for local storage, Excel use, or database import. Both contain same data. Choose based on your workflow."},
    {"question": "How far back can I export?", "answer": "Data available from channel creation. Some metrics have limited historical depth. Lifetime view useful for long-term. Export regularly to ensure you have records."},
    {"question": "Can I automate exports?", "answer": "Not natively in YouTube Studio. YouTube Analytics API allows programmatic access for developers. Third-party tools can automate. Manual export simple for most creators."}
