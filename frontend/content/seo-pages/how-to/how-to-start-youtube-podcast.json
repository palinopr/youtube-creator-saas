  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long should podcast episodes be?", "answer": "1-2 hours is standard for deep conversation. But edit ruthlessly—keep the best parts. Some successful podcasts are 30-45 minutes."},
    {"question": "Do I need a co-host?", "answer": "Not required. Solo podcasts work (monologues, interviews). Co-hosts add dynamics but complicate scheduling. Start with what's sustainable."},
    {"question": "Should I record video and audio separately?", "answer": "Yes. Always record backup audio through your interface. Video can fail. Audio backup saves episodes."},
    {"question": "How do I get guests?", "answer": "Start with your network. Reach out to bigger guests as you grow. Having 10-20 episodes builds credibility. Warm intros work best."}
