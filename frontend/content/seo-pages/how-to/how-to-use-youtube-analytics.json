  "faq": [
    {"question": "What's more important: views or watch time?", "answer": "Watch time. YouTube prioritizes videos that keep people watching. High view count with low watch time signals poor content. Aim for both, prioritize watch time."},
    {"question": "How often should I check analytics?", "answer": "Weekly for most creators. Daily for new uploads. Don't obsess over hourly fluctuations. Look for patterns over time, not single data points."},
    {"question": "What's a good click-through rate?", "answer": "4-10% is typical. Higher is better but varies by content type and traffic source. Compare your CTR to your own average, not others."},
    {"question": "Why do my impressions fluctuate?", "answer": "YouTube tests content with audiences. Low early engagement means fewer impressions. Strong performance expands reach. It's normal and algorithmic."}
