  "faq": [
    {"question": "Why aren't my chapters showing?", "answer": "Common issues: no 0:00 timestamp, fewer than 3 chapters, chapters under 10 seconds, or formatting errors. Double-check all requirements."},
    {"question": "Can I disable auto-generated chapters?", "answer": "Yes. In YouTube Studio, go to video settings and uncheck 'Allow automatic chapters'. Your manual chapters will be used instead."},
    {"question": "Do chapters help SEO?", "answer": "Yes. Chapters appear in Google search as key moments. Each chapter title is another opportunity for keyword relevance."},
    {"question": "Should I add chapters to every video?", "answer": "For longer content (10+ minutes), yes. Short videos may not need them. Tutorial and educational content benefits most."}
