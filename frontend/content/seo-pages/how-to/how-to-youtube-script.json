  "faq": [
    {"question": "Should I script word-for-word?", "answer": "Depends on your style. Some prefer bullet points for natural delivery. Others read scripts via teleprompter. Test what sounds natural for you."},
    {"question": "How long should scripts be?", "answer": "About 150 words per minute of video. 10-minute video = ~1,500 words. Adjust based on your speaking pace."},
    {"question": "How to sound natural when scripted?", "answer": "Write conversationally, practice reading aloud, use a teleprompter. Bullet points if full script feels stiff."},
    {"question": "Do all videos need scripts?", "answer": "Not necessarily. Vlogs, casual content can be unscripted. Educational, tutorial, essay-style content benefits most from scripting."}
