  "faq": [
    {"question": "How often should I review strategy?", "answer": "Monthly for metrics, quarterly for strategy adjustments. Don't pivot too quickly—give changes time to show results. Big strategy reviews annually."},
    {"question": "Should strategy be written down?", "answer": "Yes—document it. Notion, Google Doc, whatever works. Written strategy clarifies thinking and enables consistent execution."},
    {"question": "What if strategy isn't working?", "answer": "Give it time first—3-6 months minimum. Then analyze what's not working specifically. Adjust tactics before changing strategy entirely."},
    {"question": "Can I change my niche?", "answer": "Possible but costly. Existing audience may leave. Better to expand within niche than completely pivot. If you must pivot, consider new channel."}
