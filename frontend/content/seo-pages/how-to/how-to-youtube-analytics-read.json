  "faq": [
    {"question": "What's a good CTR?", "answer": "4-10% is typical. Higher for established channels, lower for viral/new content reaching broader audiences. Compare to YOUR average, not others. CTR alone doesn't matter—CTR × impressions × AVD is what counts."},
    {"question": "Why does watch time matter most?", "answer": "YouTube optimizes for time spent on platform. Watch time directly influences recommendations. A video with 50% retention on 20-minute video beats 80% retention on 3-minute video in total watch time."},
    {"question": "How to read retention graphs?", "answer": "Flat line is ideal—viewers watching through. Steep early drop = weak hook. Drops at specific points = content issues there. Spikes often indicate replays of valuable moments."},
    {"question": "Impressions but low CTR?", "answer": "YouTube testing your content with broader audience. Thumbnail/title not compelling enough. If CTR drops when impressions rise, that's normal—broader audience is less targeted."}
