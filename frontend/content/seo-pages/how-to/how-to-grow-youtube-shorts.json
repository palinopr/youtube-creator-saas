  "faq": [
    {"question": "Do Shorts subscribers watch long-form content?", "answer": "Some do, but the conversion rate is lower than long-form subscribers. Shorts are great for growth, but you need a strategy to convert casual viewers into engaged subscribers."},
    {"question": "How many Shorts should I post per day?", "answer": "1-3 Shorts daily is the sweet spot for most creators. Quality beats quantity, but consistency matters. Find a sustainable pace you can maintain."},
    {"question": "Why aren't my Shorts getting views?", "answer": "Common issues: weak hook, slow start, poor audio quality, or irrelevant hashtags. The algorithm tests your Shorts with small audiences first - a 50%+ swipe-away rate kills reach."},
    {"question": "Should I only make Shorts?", "answer": "A mix works best. Shorts drive discovery and subscribers, while long-form builds deeper connection and better monetization. Many successful creators do both."}
