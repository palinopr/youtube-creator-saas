  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long should tests run?", "answer": "Until statistically significant—usually 7-14 days minimum. More impressions = faster results. YouTube shows when data is reliable."},
    {"question": "What's good CTR improvement?", "answer": "Even 0.5-1% improvement matters at scale. Focus on consistent improvement over time. Small gains compound."},
    {"question": "Should I test every video?", "answer": "No—test high-potential videos, apply learnings broadly. Test older evergreen content for ongoing optimization."},
    {"question": "Does testing hurt video performance?", "answer": "No—YouTube optimizes for best performer. Worse thumbnail shown less. Testing generally improves overall performance."}
