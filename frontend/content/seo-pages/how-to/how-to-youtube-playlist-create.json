  "faq": [
    {"question": "How many playlists should I have?", "answer": "At least one for every topic/series you cover. More is fine—help viewers find specific content. 10-30 playlists common for established channels. Quality over quantity—each should have purpose."},
    {"question": "Do playlists help with SEO?", "answer": "Yes—playlists can rank in YouTube and Google search. Titles and descriptions indexed. Watch time from playlists signals value. Cross-link between related playlists for internal SEO."},
    {"question": "Best video order in playlists?", "answer": "Put most engaging/popular video first to hook viewers. Then logical progression. For series, chronological order. For topics, most helpful content first. Test different orders."},
    {"question": "Can I add other creators' videos?", "answer": "Yes—you can add any public video to your playlists. Good for curating helpful content for your audience. Be careful not to send viewers away from your content. Most creators stick to their own videos."}
