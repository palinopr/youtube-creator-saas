    {"question": "How many tags should I use?", "answer": "5-15 relevant tags is typical. Quality over quantity. Don't max out with irrelevant terms. YouTube has 500 character limit."},

    {"question": "Can wrong tags hurt my video?", "answer": "Misleading tags can result in lower recommendations if viewers bounce quickly. Spam-y tags might trigger manual review. Keep tags accurate."}
