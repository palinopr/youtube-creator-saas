  "faq": [
    {"question": "How big should my channel be to collab?", "answer": "Any size. Small channels collab with similar size creators. Focus on value exchange, not subscriber counts. Quality collabs matter at every level."},
    {"question": "Should I collab with smaller or bigger channels?", "answer": "Both. Bigger channels bring exposure. Similar-size collabs are easier to arrange. Smaller creators may grow alongside you."},
    {"question": "What if they don't respond?", "answer": "Normal. Most pitches get ignored. Follow up once. If no response, move on. Build relationships over time through comments and engagement."},
    {"question": "How do I make collabs not awkward?", "answer": "Prepare topics but don't script. Video call before filming to build rapport. Choose people whose energy matches yours. Practice makes perfect."}
