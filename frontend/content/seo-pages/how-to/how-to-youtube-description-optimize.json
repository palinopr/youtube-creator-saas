    {"question": "How long should descriptions be?", "answer": "At least 200 words for SEO. But quality over quantity. Cover what's needed. Some creators use 500+ words with full transcripts."},
    {"question": "Do descriptions affect search ranking?", "answer": "Yes, especially first 200 characters. YouTube uses description to understand content. Keywords here help discoverability."},
    {"question": "Should I include timestamps?", "answer": "Yes for videos over 5 minutes. Creates chapters in YouTube player. Improves user experience. Small SEO benefit too."},
    {"question": "How many hashtags should I use?", "answer": "3-5 is optimal. First 3 appear above title on desktop. Too many looks spammy. Relevant hashtags only."}
