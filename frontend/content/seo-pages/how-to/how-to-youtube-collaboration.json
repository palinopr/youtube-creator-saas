    {"question": "How to approach creators for collab?", "answer": "Engage first. Then DM with specific idea, not generic request. Show you know their content. Make it easy to say yes."},
    {"question": "What if they're bigger than me?", "answer": "Bring unique value—expertise, audience angle, production skills. Big creators collaborate with smaller if value is clear."},
    {"question": "How many collabs should I do?", "answer": "Quality over quantity. One great collab beats many mediocre ones. Build genuine relationships, not transactional partnerships."},
    {"question": "Do collabs actually help growth?", "answer": "Yes, when audiences overlap appropriately. New viewers from trusted recommendation. One of best growth strategies available."}
