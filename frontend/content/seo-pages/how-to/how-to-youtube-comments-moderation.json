  "faq": [
    {"question": "Should I hold all comments for review?", "answer": "Only for very sensitive content or small channels wanting full control. Otherwise, increased strictness is enough. Full review becomes unmanageable at scale."},
    {"question": "How to handle hate comments?", "answer": "Remove and optionally hide user. Don't respond—it encourages more. Report if severely violating. Focus energy on positive community."},
    {"question": "Can viewers see if they're hidden?", "answer": "No—hidden users see their own comments normally. They don't know they're hidden. It's shadow-ban functionality."},
    {"question": "How many moderators can I have?", "answer": "YouTube allows multiple moderators. Add trusted community members. They can approve/remove comments but not access your channel settings."}
