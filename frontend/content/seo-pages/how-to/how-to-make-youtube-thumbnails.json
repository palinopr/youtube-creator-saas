  "faq": [
    {"question": "What size should YouTube thumbnails be?", "answer": "1280x720 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio) is the recommended size. This gives you full resolution while maintaining the correct proportions. Minimum is 640x360."},
    {"question": "Should I use text on thumbnails?", "answer": "Only if it adds value beyond the title. 3 words or fewer works best. Text should be large enough to read on mobile. Don't duplicate your video title."},
    {"question": "Do I need Photoshop for good thumbnails?", "answer": "No, Canva's free version is enough for professional thumbnails. The design principles matter more than the software. Many successful YouTubers use Canva exclusively."},
    {"question": "How important is consistency in thumbnails?", "answer": "Very important for brand recognition. Use consistent colors, fonts, and style so viewers recognize your videos instantly. This builds trust and increases CTR over time."}
