  "faq": [
    {"question": "Minimum video length for end screens?", "answer": "25 seconds minimum. End screens can appear in last 5-20 seconds, so video must be at least 25 seconds. Shorts don't support end screens."},
    {"question": "What's 'best for viewer'?", "answer": "Algorithm chooses video most likely to interest that specific viewer. Usually performs well. Alternative to manually selecting specific video."},
    {"question": "Why aren't my end screens showing?", "answer": "Check: video over 25 seconds, not a Short, end screen properly saved. Some viewers have elements disabled. Mobile shows differently than desktop."},
    {"question": "How many elements should I use?", "answer": "2-4 elements typical. One video/playlist, one subscribe button is minimum. Don't overcrowd—cluttered end screens get ignored."}
