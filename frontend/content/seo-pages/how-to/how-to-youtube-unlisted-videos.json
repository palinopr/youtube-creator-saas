  "faq": [
    {"question": "Difference between unlisted and private?", "answer": "Unlisted: anyone with the link can watch. Private: only you and up to 50 invited people (Google accounts). Private requires login, unlisted doesn't. Choose based on security need."},
    {"question": "Can unlisted videos be found?", "answer": "Not through YouTube search or recommendations. But if someone shares the link, others can watch. Not truly secure for confidential content. Use private for sensitive material."},
    {"question": "Do unlisted videos count for channel stats?", "answer": "Views count toward your total but don't contribute to public metrics visible to others. Watch time counts for YPP requirements. Good for testing content before public release."},
    {"question": "Can I make public videos unlisted?", "answer": "Yes—change visibility anytime. Existing links still work. Video disappears from channel page and search. Comments remain. Views already counted remain in stats."}
