    {"question": "What are timestamps/chapters?", "answer": "Format: 0:00 Introduction. Creates clickable chapters in video player. Improves user experience and SEO. YouTube may show in search results. Start at 0:00, minimum 3 timestamps, 10+ seconds each."},
    {"question": "How many hashtags should I use?", "answer": "3-5 hashtags optimal. First 3 appear above video title clickable. Too many looks spammy. Use specific, relevant tags. Mix broad and niche hashtags."}
