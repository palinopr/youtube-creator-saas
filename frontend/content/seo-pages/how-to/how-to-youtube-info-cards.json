  "faq": [
    {"question": "Maximum cards per video?", "answer": "YouTube allows 5 cards per video. Use them strategically at relevant moments. Too many feels spammy and reduces effectiveness."},
    {"question": "Do cards work on all devices?", "answer": "Yes, but appearance varies. Desktop shows 'i' icon. Mobile shows as tappable overlay. Test on both platforms to understand experience."},
    {"question": "Cards vs end screens?", "answer": "Both valuable, different uses. Cards work throughout video for timely suggestions. End screens are final call-to-action. Use both strategically."},
    {"question": "Can I add external links?", "answer": "Only with YouTube Partner Program membership. Links must go to approved sites. Most creators link to their own website or merchandise."}
