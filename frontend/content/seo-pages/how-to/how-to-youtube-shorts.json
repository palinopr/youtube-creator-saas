    {"question": "Do Shorts help channel growth?", "answer": "Yes for reach and subscribers. Shorts get massive impressions. But watch time from Shorts doesn't count toward YPP watch hours (separate path)."},
    {"question": "Can I repurpose TikToks?", "answer": "Yes, but remove TikTok watermarks. YouTube may limit reach of watermarked content. Re-edit or use original files."},
    {"question": "How often should I post Shorts?", "answer": "1-3 per day is common for growth. Consistency matters more than volume. Find sustainable cadence for you."},
    {"question": "Shorts vs long-form—which matters more?", "answer": "Both have value. Shorts for discovery and reach. Long-form for watch time and deeper engagement. Many creators do both."}
