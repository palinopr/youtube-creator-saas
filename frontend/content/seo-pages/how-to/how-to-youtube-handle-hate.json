  "faq": [
    {"question": "Should I respond to hate comments?", "answer": "Almost never—trolls want engagement. Responding gives them power and encourages more. Delete, block, move on. Exception: factual corrections that help other viewers, delivered calmly."},
    {"question": "Does deleting comments look bad?", "answer": "No—it's your channel, your community. You set the culture. Most viewers never see deleted comments. Curating a positive space attracts positive people. Delete freely."},
    {"question": "How to handle false accusations?", "answer": "Consider once if there's any truth to learn from. If genuinely false, don't engage with every accusation—it amplifies. Address calmly once if needed for your community, then move on."},
    {"question": "When to take a break?", "answer": "When negativity affects your mood, creativity, or motivation. When you dread checking comments. When one bad comment ruins your day. Breaks are healthy and necessary—the channel will survive."}
