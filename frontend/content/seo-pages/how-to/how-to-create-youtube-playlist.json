    {"question": "Do playlists help algorithm?", "answer": "Yes. Playlist watch sessions signal content quality. They rank in search. Featured playlists improve channel page performance."},
    {"question": "Can I add other creators' videos?", "answer": "Yes. Curated playlists can include any public video. Good for topic collections. But focus on your content for channel growth."}
