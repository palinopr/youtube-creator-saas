  "faq": [
    {"question": "What size should thumbnails be?", "answer": "1280x720 pixels minimum, 16:9 aspect ratio. 1920x1080 even better. Under 2MB file size."},
    {"question": "Should I always show my face?", "answer": "Not always, but faces with emotion typically get highest CTR. Test for your niche. Gaming and tutorial content may not need faces."},
    {"question": "How important are thumbnails really?", "answer": "Extremely. Same video with better thumbnail can get 2-3x more clicks. It's your first impression. Worth investing time."},
    {"question": "Can I change thumbnails after posting?", "answer": "Yes. Go to YouTube Studio, edit video details. Many creators update thumbnails to improve performance."}
