  "faq": [
    {"question": "What's a good retention rate?", "answer": "50%+ average is solid. 60%+ is excellent. New channels often see 30-40%. Focus on improvement over time rather than hitting specific numbers."},
    {"question": "Where should I check retention?", "answer": "YouTube Studio > Analytics > Engagement > Audience retention. Look at the graph shape and identify where viewers leave. Each video teaches you something."},
    {"question": "Does video length affect retention?", "answer": "Longer videos naturally have lower percentage retention but more total watch time. Optimal length varies by content. Don't pad short topics or cut long ones short."},
    {"question": "How do I fix retention dips?", "answer": "Study where dips occur. Common causes: slow sections, off-topic tangents, unfulfilled promises. Edit tighter, add pattern interrupts, or restructure content."}
