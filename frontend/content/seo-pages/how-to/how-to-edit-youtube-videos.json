    {"question": "What's the best free editing software?", "answer": "DaVinci Resolve is the most powerful free option with professional features. CapCut is easier for beginners. Both are genuinely free, not trials."},
    {"question": "How long should editing take?", "answer": "Expect 2-4 hours of editing per finished minute when starting out. With practice and templates, this drops to 1-2 hours or less."},
    {"question": "Should I edit my own videos?", "answer": "Start by editing yourself to learn the craft and your style. As you grow, outsourcing editing frees time for more content and strategy."},
    {"question": "What export settings should I use?", "answer": "1080p at 30fps or 4K at 24-60fps. H.264 codec. High bitrate (15+ Mbps for 1080p, 35+ for 4K). YouTube re-compresses, so start with quality."}
