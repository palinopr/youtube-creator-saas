    {"question": "How important is SEO for YouTube?", "answer": "Important for discoverability, but not everything. Watch time, CTR, and engagement are ranking factors too. SEO gets you in the game."},
    {"question": "How long to see SEO results?", "answer": "YouTube videos can rank over time—not instant like web pages. Some videos rank after months. Evergreen content benefits most."},
    {"question": "Should I change titles after posting?", "answer": "Yes, if performance is poor. Wait 48-72 hours for initial data. A/B test titles if views are low but impressions exist."},
    {"question": "Do tags really matter?", "answer": "Minor factor, but easy to do. Tags help with misspellings and context. Title and description matter more."}
