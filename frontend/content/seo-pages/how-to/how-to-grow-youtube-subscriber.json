  "faq": [
    {"question": "Does asking people to subscribe actually work?", "answer": "Yes. Studies show CTAs increase subscriptions. Many viewers don't think to subscribe. A simple ask converts."},
    {"question": "How long does it take to reach 1,000 subscribers?", "answer": "Varies wildly. Some take months, others years. Focus on making better content, not the number. Growth often accelerates after critical mass."},
    {"question": "Should I buy subscribers?", "answer": "Absolutely not. Fake subscribers don't watch, hurt engagement metrics, and can get your channel banned. There are no shortcuts."},
    {"question": "What's more important: subscribers or views?", "answer": "Views drive revenue. Subscribers drive loyalty. Best content strategy optimizes for both. Subscribers who watch are most valuable."}
