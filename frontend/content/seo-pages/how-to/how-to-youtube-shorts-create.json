  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best length for Shorts?", "answer": "15-30 seconds often performs best. Long enough for value, short enough for replay. Under 60 is requirement. Test different lengths for your content."},
    {"question": "Do I need #Shorts in title?", "answer": "Helps with discovery but not strictly required. YouTube recognizes vertical under-60s format. Including it doesn't hurt and may help."},
    {"question": "Can I repurpose TikToks?", "answer": "Yes—but remove TikTok watermark. YouTube may deprioritize watermarked content. Re-export from original or use tools to remove."},
    {"question": "How often should I post Shorts?", "answer": "Daily or several times weekly for best results. Consistency matters for algorithm. Quality still important—don't sacrifice for quantity."}
