  "faq": [
    {"question": "What's the difference between claim and strike?", "answer": "Claim: usually Content ID automated, affects monetization. Strike: manual takedown request, serious penalty, 3 strikes = channel termination. Claims don't become strikes unless you dispute and lose."},
    {"question": "Can I use copyrighted music if I credit?", "answer": "No—credit doesn't grant permission. You need actual license. 'No copyright intended' means nothing legally. Use licensed music from Epidemic Sound, Artlist, or YouTube Audio Library."},
    {"question": "Is fair use automatic protection?", "answer": "No—fair use is a legal defense, not automatic right. It's complex (purpose, amount, effect on market). Commentary/criticism helps, but not guaranteed. Many disputes over fair use fail."},
    {"question": "How long do claims last?", "answer": "Claims can be permanent unless disputed/released. Some claimants release after period. You can trim claimed content to remove. Video stays up with monetization claim—just revenue affected."}
