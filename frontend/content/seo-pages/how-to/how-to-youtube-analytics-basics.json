    {"question": "How often should I check analytics?", "answer": "Weekly for trends, not daily for obsession. Daily checking causes anxiety over normal fluctuations. Focus on patterns, not individual data points."},
    {"question": "Which metric matters most?", "answer": "Watch time and retention for algorithm. CTR for thumbnails/titles. Subscribers for community. All matter—but watch time drives recommendations."},
    {"question": "Why did my views suddenly drop?", "answer": "Check if traffic source changed. Seasonal patterns. Algorithm shifts. One viral video ending its run. Usually temporary unless content quality dropped."},
    {"question": "What's a good retention rate?", "answer": "50%+ of video length is excellent. 30-50% is good. Below 30% needs improvement. First 30 seconds is most critical—hook viewers fast."}
