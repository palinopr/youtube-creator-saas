  "faq": [
    {"question": "How much can you make from merch?", "answer": "Varies wildly—depends on audience size, engagement, and product relevance. Profit margins typically 20-40% per item. Some creators earn more from merch than ads. Start small, test what sells."},
    {"question": "Best products for YouTube merch?", "answer": "T-shirts most common and expected. Hoodies higher profit margin. Mugs, stickers for lower price points. Inside jokes and catchphrases perform well. Quality matters for repeat customers."},
    {"question": "Can I use my own merch store?", "answer": "Merch shelf requires approved partners only. You can still link to external stores in descriptions and pinned comments. Some creators use both—shelf for convenience, external for full catalog."},
    {"question": "Why isn't merch shelf showing?", "answer": "Check eligibility requirements met. Ensure products approved and published. Some videos may not show shelf based on content. Feature can take time to activate after setup."}
