  "faq": [
    {"question": "Does premiere help the algorithm?", "answer": "Premieres can boost initial engagement signals—chat, likes, comments concentrated at launch. Good performance may help recommendations."},
    {"question": "Should I premiere every video?", "answer": "No. Reserve for special content. Too frequent premieres train audience to wait, reducing casual views. Monthly or for major content."},
    {"question": "Can I edit premiere after scheduling?", "answer": "Yes. Title, description, thumbnail can change. Can't change premiere time once scheduled—would need to cancel and reschedule."},
    {"question": "What if I miss my own premiere?", "answer": "Video still goes live. Chat continues without you. Ideally be present, but premiere works regardless."}
