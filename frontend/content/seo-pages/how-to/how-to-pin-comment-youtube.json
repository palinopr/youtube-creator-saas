    {"question": "Can I pin my own comment?", "answer": "Yes. Most creators pin their own comments. Write your comment, then pin it. Great for questions or added context."},
    {"question": "How many comments can I pin?", "answer": "Only one per video. Pinning a new comment unpins the previous one. Choose strategically."},
    {"question": "Do pinned comments affect algorithm?", "answer": "Indirectly. They can increase engagement (more replies), which signals active content. But pinning itself isn't a ranking factor."},
    {"question": "Should I always have a pinned comment?", "answer": "Not required. But it's an opportunity. Even a simple question can boost engagement significantly."}
