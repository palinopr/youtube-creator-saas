  "faq": [
    {"question": "Are auto-captions good enough?", "answer": "No—always edit. Auto-captions have errors that look unprofessional and hurt accessibility. 5-10 minutes editing is worth it."},
    {"question": "Do captions help SEO?", "answer": "Yes. YouTube indexes caption text for search. Accurate captions with keywords naturally included improve discoverability."},
    {"question": "Should I add other languages?", "answer": "If you have international audience, yes. Check Analytics for viewer locations. Professional translation recommended over auto-translate."},
    {"question": "How to add captions faster?", "answer": "Tools like Descript or Rev.com transcribe accurately. Edit their output, export SRT, upload to YouTube. Faster than manual."}
