  "faq": [
    {"question": "Can I get verified under 100K?", "answer": "Extremely rare. Only for highly notable public figures with significant impersonation risk. For most creators, 100K is the threshold."},
    {"question": "How long does verification take?", "answer": "Varies—days to weeks. YouTube reviews manually. No way to speed up the process. Continue creating while waiting."},
    {"question": "Does verification help growth?", "answer": "Minimal direct impact on algorithm. Main benefit is credibility and impersonation protection. Don't expect growth spike from checkmark."},
    {"question": "Can verification be removed?", "answer": "Yes—community guidelines strikes, channel abandonment, or found to be misrepresenting identity can result in removal."}
