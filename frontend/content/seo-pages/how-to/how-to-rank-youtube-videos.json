    {"question": "How long does it take to rank on YouTube?", "answer": "New videos can rank within hours for low-competition keywords, or weeks for competitive terms. YouTube also evaluates watch time signals over time, so rankings can improve as your video proves it satisfies viewers."},
    {"question": "Are YouTube tags still important?", "answer": "Tags are less important than they used to be but still help. They serve as secondary context for YouTube. Put more effort into title and description, but don't skip tags entirely."},
    {"question": "How do I find good keywords?", "answer": "Use YouTube's search autocomplete, TubeGrow's keyword research, or analyze what keywords successful competitors rank for. Look for keywords with decent search volume but manageable competition."},
    {"question": "Can I change SEO elements after uploading?", "answer": "Yes, you can update title, description, tags, and thumbnail anytime. If a video isn't ranking, try adjusting these elements. Give changes 1-2 weeks to take effect."}
