    {"question": "Best microphone for voiceover?", "answer": "USB condensers like Rode NT-USB or Blue Yeti work great. XLR options with interface sound better. Start USB, upgrade later."},
    {"question": "How do I reduce room echo?", "answer": "Record in small space with soft surfaces. Closets with clothes work. Acoustic panels, blankets, or moving blankets help."},
    {"question": "Should I read from script?", "answer": "Script ensures accuracy and efficiency. Practice until it sounds natural. Bullet points work for conversational style."},
    {"question": "How to sound more natural?", "answer": "Smile, vary your pace, emphasize key words. Read aloud to yourself first. Record multiple takes. Edit the best parts together."}
