    {"question": "How to check if I have Brand Account?", "answer": "YouTube Studio > Settings > Channel > See 'Advanced settings'. It shows account type. Brand Account shows 'This account is managed by a Brand Account.'"},
    {"question": "Can I convert personal to Brand Account?", "answer": "Yes—in YouTube Settings, 'Move channel to a Brand Account'. Creates Brand Account and moves content. Doesn't affect videos or subscribers."},
    {"question": "How many managers can I add?", "answer": "Up to 50 managers per Brand Account. Plenty for most teams. Remove inactive managers periodically for security."},
    {"question": "Is Brand Account required?", "answer": "No—personal accounts work fine for solo creators. Brand Account mainly useful for teams, businesses, or future transferability."}
