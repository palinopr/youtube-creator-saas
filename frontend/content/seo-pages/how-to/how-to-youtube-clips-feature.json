  "faq": [
    {"question": "Do clips hurt my watch time?", "answer": "No—clips always link back to full video. They drive discovery. A clip is marketing, not a replacement. Viewers often watch clip then full video."},
    {"question": "Can I disable clips on certain videos?", "answer": "Yes—per-video setting in video details. Some creators disable for sensitive content or when clips might be taken out of context. Generally keep enabled."},
    {"question": "How long can clips be?", "answer": "5 to 60 seconds. Shorter clips more shareable. Longer clips for context. Sweet spot often 15-30 seconds for social sharing."},
    {"question": "Do I get revenue from clips?", "answer": "Not directly from clip views. But clips drive traffic to full video where you do earn. Think of clips as marketing spend that costs nothing."}
