  "faq": [
    {"question": "Should I have an intro at all?", "answer": "Probably not. Data shows intros hurt retention. Hook + content first. Brief logo flash optional. Many top creators skip entirely."},
    {"question": "How long should intro be?", "answer": "If you insist: 2-5 seconds maximum. Even 10 seconds is too long. Every second before content risks viewer leaving."},
    {"question": "Do outros help?", "answer": "Yes—viewers who reach outro are engaged. End screen boosts next video clicks. Worth investing in good outro template."},
    {"question": "Best tool for simple intro?", "answer": "Canva is easiest. Panzoid for 3D templates. Keep it simple—fancy isn't necessary. Memorable is better than impressive."}
