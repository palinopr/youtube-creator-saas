  "faq": [
    {"question": "Doesn't this hurt my YouTube views?", "answer": "Opposite usually. Short clips drive people to full videos. Different platforms reach different audiences. Cross-promotion helps growth."},
    {"question": "How do I make vertical clips from horizontal video?", "answer": "Crop and reframe key elements to center. Use auto-caption tools. Some edit in CapCut or Premiere. Plan for vertical during filming."},
    {"question": "How much content can I extract from one video?", "answer": "Depends on video length and density. 15-minute video might yield 3-5 Shorts, 10 tweets, 1 blog post. Get more from content-rich videos."},
    {"question": "Should I post same clip everywhere?", "answer": "Adjust for platform culture. TikTok wants native feel, LinkedIn wants business angle. Same core clip, different context and framing."}
