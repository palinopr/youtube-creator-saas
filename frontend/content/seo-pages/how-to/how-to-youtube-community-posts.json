    {"question": "When do I get Community tab access?", "answer": "Available at 500 subscribers. Previously required 1000. Once unlocked, appears as tab on your channel page."},
    {"question": "How often should I post?", "answer": "1-3 times per week is typical. More feels spammy, less loses momentum. Quality over quantity. Post when you have something valuable."},
    {"question": "What posts get most engagement?", "answer": "Polls consistently perform best—low friction to participate. Questions that are easy to answer. Behind-the-scenes photos. Avoid pure self-promotion."},
    {"question": "Do community posts help with algorithm?", "answer": "They maintain subscriber engagement which signals active channel. Posts can appear on home feeds. Not direct ranking factor but supports overall channel health."}
