  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long should YouTube titles be?", "answer": "Under 60 characters to avoid truncation. Put the most important words first. Longer titles work if the crucial info is at the beginning."},
    {"question": "Should I put keywords at the start?", "answer": "Yes for SEO, but balance with click appeal. 'How to' or compelling hooks can come first, with keywords naturally integrated."},
    {"question": "Is clickbait bad?", "answer": "Misleading clickbait is bad (damages trust and retention). Compelling titles that deliver on promise are good. Never promise what you don't deliver."},
    {"question": "Can I change titles after publishing?", "answer": "Yes. Changing titles can improve performance on underperforming videos. YouTube may re-evaluate the video with new title/thumbnail."}
