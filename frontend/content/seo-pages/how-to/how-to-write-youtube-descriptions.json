  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long should YouTube descriptions be?", "answer": "Aim for 200-300 words minimum. Use all available space for SEO benefit, but make it readable. Quality content beats keyword-stuffed fluff."},

    {"question": "Should I use hashtags in descriptions?", "answer": "Use 3-5 relevant hashtags maximum. More than that looks spammy and doesn't help. Put them at the end of your description."},
