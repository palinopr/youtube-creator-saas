    {"question": "What if my handle is taken?", "answer": "Try variations: add underscores, abbreviate, use 'TV' or 'Official' suffix. Some handles are reserved—check different options."},
    {"question": "Can I change my handle later?", "answer": "Yes, but limited to twice per 14 days. Your old handle becomes available immediately. Think carefully before changing."},
    {"question": "Is handle same as channel name?", "answer": "No. Channel name is your display name (can include spaces, emoji). Handle is your @username (limited characters). They can differ."},
    {"question": "Do I need a handle?", "answer": "YouTube assigns one if you don't choose. But claiming yours early ensures you get what you want before it's taken."}
