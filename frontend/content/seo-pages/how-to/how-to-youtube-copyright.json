    {"question": "Claim vs strike difference?", "answer": "Claims affect monetization. Strikes can remove videos and threaten channel. Claims are common; strikes are serious."},
    {"question": "Is fair use guaranteed protection?", "answer": "No—fair use is a legal defense, not automatic permission. It's determined case-by-case, sometimes only in court. Be cautious."},
    {"question": "Can I use 10 seconds of music?", "answer": "No magic number exists. Content ID can detect very short clips. Even seconds can be claimed. Safer to use royalty-free."},
    {"question": "What if claim is wrong?", "answer": "Dispute it with evidence. Explain why use is fair or why you have rights. Claimant has 30 days to respond. Be prepared."}
