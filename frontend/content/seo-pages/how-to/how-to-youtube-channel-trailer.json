  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long should channel trailer be?", "answer": "30-90 seconds ideal. Under 60 is best for attention spans. Long enough to show value, short enough to respect time. Test different lengths."},
    {"question": "Should I create a trailer immediately?", "answer": "Wait until you have some content. Trailer should show your best work. First 10-20 videos, then create trailer from highlights."},
    {"question": "Can I use existing video as trailer?", "answer": "Yes, many creators do. Your best-performing video or a strong representative video works. Dedicated trailer with CTA often converts better though."},
    {"question": "How often to update trailer?", "answer": "Annually minimum. Update when channel focus shifts, after major growth, or when your style evolves significantly. Outdated trailers hurt conversion."}
