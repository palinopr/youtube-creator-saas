    {"question": "Is DaVinci Resolve really free?", "answer": "Yes. The free version is remarkably full-featured. Studio adds some features ($295) but free version handles 95% of YouTube needs."},
    {"question": "What's the best one-time purchase?", "answer": "Final Cut Pro ($300) for Mac users. Vegas Pro or Resolve Studio for Windows. All are perpetual licenses."},
    {"question": "Can I open Premiere projects elsewhere?", "answer": "Not directly. Export XMLs transfer some data. Mostly you'll rebuild projects. Many alternatives have similar workflows though."},
    {"question": "Which has the easiest learning curve?", "answer": "Filmora and CapCut are most beginner-friendly. DaVinci Resolve is powerful but steeper curve. Final Cut is intuitive for Mac users."}
