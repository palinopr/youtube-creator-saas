    {"question": "Is Audacity still good?", "answer": "Yes, very capable and completely free. Interface is dated but functional. Privacy concerns addressed in recent versions."},

    {"question": "Descript worth the cost?", "answer": "For podcasters, often yes. Text-based editing is revolutionary for spoken word. Less useful for music or sound design."},
    {"question": "What about Adobe Audition?", "answer": "Professional tool, excellent for podcasts. Subscription model expensive if you only need basic editing. Worth it for professionals."}
