  "faq": [
    {"question": "What's the closest to Final Cut on Windows?", "answer": "DaVinci Resolve for power users, Premiere for industry compatibility. Resolve's magnetic timeline is different. Premiere's workflow is more traditional."},
    {"question": "Is DaVinci Resolve really free?", "answer": "The free version includes almost everything. Studio version ($295) adds noise reduction, some effects, and more GPU acceleration. Free is enough for most."},
    {"question": "Should I switch from Final Cut to Premiere?", "answer": "Only if you need Windows compatibility or Adobe integration. Final Cut runs better on Mac. Switching has a learning curve—only switch with good reason."},
    {"question": "What's the easiest alternative?", "answer": "CapCut Desktop or Filmora. Both are simpler than Final Cut but less powerful. Good for beginners or quick edits."}
