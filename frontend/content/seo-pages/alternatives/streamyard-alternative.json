    {"question": "Is OBS better than StreamYard?", "answer": "OBS is more powerful and free, but harder to learn. StreamYard is easier for beginners and better for remote guests. OBS for customization, StreamYard for simplicity."},

    {"question": "Can I multistream with alternatives?", "answer": "Restream is best for multistreaming. OBS needs additional tools (Restream or similar). StreamYard does multistream but Restream specializes in it."},
