  "faq": [
    {"question": "Is there a free Descript alternative?", "answer": "Kapwing offers text-based editing with free tier. CapCut is completely free with auto-captions. Neither matches Descript's full feature set, but capable for basic needs."},
    {"question": "Best for podcasters?", "answer": "Riverside.fm if you need recording too. Descript still strong for podcast editing. Otter.ai for transcription-only. Depends on workflow needs."},
    {"question": "Can I edit video by text elsewhere?", "answer": "Kapwing and Riverside offer text-based editing. Less refined than Descript but functional. Traditional editors with good transcription (Premiere) offer similar workflow."},
    {"question": "Is Descript worth the price?", "answer": "For heavy podcast/video editing with text-based workflow, yes. For occasional use, free alternatives work. Evaluate based on time saved vs cost."}
