    {"question": "Is there a free Camtasia alternative?", "answer": "OBS Studio for recording is completely free and powerful. Combine with DaVinci Resolve (free) for editing. Together they exceed Camtasia's capabilities at zero cost."},
    {"question": "Best for tutorial videos?", "answer": "ScreenPal (Screencast-O-Matic) is purpose-built for tutorials, more affordable. Loom great for quick tutorials with instant sharing. Camtasia's annotations are hard to match though."},
    {"question": "OBS vs Camtasia?", "answer": "OBS: free, unlimited recording, steeper learning curve, no built-in editing. Camtasia: paid, integrated editing, easier for beginners, annotations included. OBS + DaVinci is more powerful but requires learning both."},
    {"question": "Best for courses?", "answer": "Camtasia's templates and consistency good for courses. ScreenPal offers similar. Loom for quick lessons. Consider your editing needs—if complex, separate recorder + professional editor may be better."}
