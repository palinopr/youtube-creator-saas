  "faq": [
    {"question": "Is Streamlabs better than OBS?", "answer": "Streamlabs is easier with more built-in features but uses more resources. OBS is leaner and more customizable. Streamlabs is OBS underneath with extras."},
    {"question": "What about just screen recording?", "answer": "For recording only: OBS, ShadowPlay, and built-in Windows Game Bar work well. Camtasia adds editing. Loom is great for quick recordings."},
    {"question": "Do I need streaming software for YouTube?", "answer": "Only for live streaming. Pre-recorded videos just need screen recording and video editing. OBS handles both but simpler tools exist."},
    {"question": "What's the best low-resource option?", "answer": "NVIDIA ShadowPlay has minimal performance impact if you have an NVIDIA GPU. Otherwise, OBS is reasonably efficient when configured properly."}
