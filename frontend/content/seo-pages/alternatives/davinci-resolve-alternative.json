  "faq": [
    {"question": "Why would I switch from free Resolve?", "answer": "Learning curve, system requirements, or workflow preference. Some find Premiere easier. Others need lighter software. Free doesn't mean right for everyone."},
    {"question": "Is Premiere Pro easier than Resolve?", "answer": "The timeline and basic editing is more intuitive for many. Resolve's power is in color, which adds complexity. Premiere feels more traditional."},
    {"question": "What's the best free alternative to Resolve?", "answer": "CapCut for simple editing, Kdenlive for more features, iMovie for Mac users. None match Resolve's features, but they're easier to learn."},
    {"question": "Should I learn Resolve despite the difficulty?", "answer": "If you're serious about video, probably yes. It's free and professional-grade. But start simpler if you're overwhelmed—skills transfer later."}
