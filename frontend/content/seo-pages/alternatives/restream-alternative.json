    {"question": "Can I multistream for free?", "answer": "Yes—OBS with multi-rtmp plugin works well. Requires more technical setup. Prism has limited free tier. True free options exist."},
    {"question": "Is StreamYard better than Restream?", "answer": "Different focus. StreamYard better for guests and production. Restream better for pure multistreaming to many platforms. Depends on needs."},
    {"question": "What about just streaming to YouTube?", "answer": "YouTube alone is fine for most creators. Multistreaming spreads audience thin. Consider: is multistreaming necessary for your goals?"},
    {"question": "Best for multistreaming with guests?", "answer": "StreamYard or Riverside for guests. Restream's guest features are basic. If interviews are priority, guest-focused platforms work better."}
