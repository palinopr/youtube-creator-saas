  "faq": [
    {"question": "Is Anchor really free?", "answer": "Yes, but with limitations. Spotify owns your monetization. Analytics are basic. Fine for starting, but serious podcasters often upgrade."},
    {"question": "Can I move from Anchor easily?", "answer": "Yes. Export your RSS feed and import to new host. Redirect your feed. Most platforms have migration guides."},
    {"question": "Which has best analytics?", "answer": "Buzzsprout and Captivate have excellent analytics. Transistor is good too. All far exceed Anchor's basic stats."},
    {"question": "Best for video podcasts on YouTube?", "answer": "Podbean has video podcast features. But for YouTube specifically, just upload directly to YouTube. Use audio host for podcast apps."}
