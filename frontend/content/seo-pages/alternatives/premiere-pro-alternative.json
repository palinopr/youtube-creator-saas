    {"question": "What's the best free Premiere alternative?", "answer": "DaVinci Resolve is the most powerful free option. It rivals Premiere in features and exceeds it in color grading. CapCut is easier for beginners."},
    {"question": "Is DaVinci Resolve really free?", "answer": "Yes. The free version includes nearly everything. The $295 Studio version adds noise reduction, HDR tools, and collaboration features."},
    {"question": "Can I switch without losing my skills?", "answer": "Core editing concepts transfer between all professional editors. Interface and shortcuts differ, but fundamentals remain the same."},
    {"question": "What if I need After Effects integration?", "answer": "That's Premiere's main lock-in. DaVinci's Fusion is comparable. Final Cut has Motion. None match Dynamic Link perfectly, but alternatives exist."}
