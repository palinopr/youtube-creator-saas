    {"question": "Is OBS really as good as Streamlabs?", "answer": "Core streaming quality is identical—Streamlabs is built on OBS. OBS is lighter. Streamlabs has integrated alerts/widgets. Choose based on needs."},
    {"question": "Why switch from Streamlabs?", "answer": "Resource usage concerns, privacy preferences, or wanting pure OBS experience. Some find Streamlabs heavy on older systems."},
    {"question": "What about alerts without Streamlabs?", "answer": "Browser sources work in OBS. StreamElements is popular. Many alert services integrate with pure OBS."},
    {"question": "Is Ecamm worth it for Mac?", "answer": "If you stream regularly, yes. Native Mac app performs better. Great for professional-looking streams. Worth the investment for serious streamers."}
