  "faq": [
    {"question": "Is Premiere Pro better than Final Cut?", "answer": "Neither is objectively better—different strengths. Premiere: cross-platform, Adobe integration. Final Cut: Apple optimization, one-time purchase. Choose based on workflow needs."},
    {"question": "Best free alternative to Final Cut?", "answer": "DaVinci Resolve free version is remarkably capable. Professional color grading, Fairlight audio. Some features locked to Studio version, but free tier handles most YouTube needs."},
    {"question": "Can I transfer Final Cut projects?", "answer": "Direct transfer difficult—different project formats. XML export to some degree. Practically, you'll rebuild projects. Consider during transition planning."},
    {"question": "Why not just use Final Cut?", "answer": "Mac-only is biggest limitation. $300 upfront cost. Some prefer Premiere's integration or Resolve's color tools. Personal preference and workflow matter."}
