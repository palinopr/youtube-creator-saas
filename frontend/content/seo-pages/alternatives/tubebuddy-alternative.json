    {"question": "Is VidIQ better than TubeBuddy?", "answer": "They're comparable with different strengths. VidIQ has slightly better keyword tools; TubeBuddy has A/B testing. Try both free versions and see which workflow fits you better."},
    {"question": "Can I use free YouTube tools instead?", "answer": "YouTube Studio provides solid analytics. Free tools can work, but paid alternatives save significant time on keyword research, competitor analysis, and optimization recommendations."},
    {"question": "Will I lose data switching from TubeBuddy?", "answer": "TubeBuddy data is enhancement of YouTube's data, which you keep regardless of tool. Your channel history and analytics stay with YouTube. Only tool-specific tracking is lost."},
    {"question": "What's the most affordable alternative?", "answer": "VidIQ and TubeGrow both have generous free tiers. For paid plans, prices are competitive. Look at what features you actually need rather than just comparing prices."}
