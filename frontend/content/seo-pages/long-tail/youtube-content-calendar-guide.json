  "faq": [
    {"question": "How far ahead should I plan?", "answer": "4-8 weeks for topics, 2-4 weeks detailed production schedule. Too far ahead becomes rigid; too short creates stress."},

    {"question": "Should calendar be rigid?", "answer": "No—flexibility is key. Calendar is guide, not prison. Adapt to trends, energy, audience feedback. Planning enables spontaneity."},
    {"question": "How to handle creative blocks with calendar?", "answer": "Planning ahead helps—always have backup topics. Keep 'rainy day' ideas list. Calendar pressure is motivation, not stress."}
