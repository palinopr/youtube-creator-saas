  "faq": [
    {"question": "How to reach out to bigger creators?", "answer": "Don't ask for collab immediately. Provide value first—thoughtful comments, share their content, help in their community. Build genuine relationship over months."},
    {"question": "Should I collab with smaller channels?", "answer": "Yes—growing together creates lasting partnerships. Today's small channel might be tomorrow's big collaborator. Quality over size."},
    {"question": "What if they say no?", "answer": "Common and normal. Don't take it personally. Thank them, stay friendly, try again later with better offer. Many successful collabs happen on second or third ask."},
    {"question": "How often should I collab?", "answer": "Monthly is sustainable for most creators. More frequent can overwhelm your core content. Less frequent may not build enough relationships. Find your rhythm."}
