  "faq": [
    {"question": "Does upload time really matter?", "answer": "Yes, but less than content quality. Optimal timing provides 10-20% boost in initial views. Not make-or-break, but worth optimizing."},
    {"question": "How often should beginners post?", "answer": "Once per week is sustainable for most. Twice if you can maintain quality. Daily is rarely sustainable long-term."},
    {"question": "Should I post on holidays?", "answer": "Depends on niche. Entertainment does well. Business content may underperform. Consider audience behavior during specific holidays."},
    {"question": "What if I can't maintain schedule?", "answer": "Communicate with audience. Occasional breaks are fine. Better to skip a week than post rushed content. Burnout is real."}
