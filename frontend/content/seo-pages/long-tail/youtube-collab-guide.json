  "faq": [
    {"question": "How to find creators to collab with?", "answer": "Search your niche, check who your audience also watches, browse collab hashtags, join creator communities. Focus on similar-size channels."},
    {"question": "When is my channel ready for collabs?", "answer": "No minimum, but having established content (20+ videos) and consistent quality helps. You need something valuable to offer."},
    {"question": "What if they don't respond?", "answer": "Follow up once after 1-2 weeks. If still no response, move on. They might be busy or not interested—both are okay."},
    {"question": "Should I pay for collabs?", "answer": "Generally no for peer collabs. If paying, it's sponsorship, not collaboration. True collabs exchange value, not money."}
