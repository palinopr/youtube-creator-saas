    {"question": "What's a good impression count?", "answer": "Depends entirely on channel size and niche. Compare to your own videos. Look at impression-to-view ratio (CTR) more than raw impressions."},

    {"question": "Do impressions affect the algorithm?", "answer": "Impressions are output, not input. You don't directly control them. Algorithm gives more impressions to content with good CTR and retention."},
    {"question": "How to track impression sources?", "answer": "YouTube Studio > Analytics > Reach > Traffic source types. Shows where impressions and views come from. Optimize for your top sources."}
