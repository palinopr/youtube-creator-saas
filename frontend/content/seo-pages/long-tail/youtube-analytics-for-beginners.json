  "faq": [
    {"question": "How often should I check YouTube Analytics?", "answer": "Once daily is enough. More frequent checking leads to anxiety over normal fluctuations. Give your content time to find its audience before judging performance."},
    {"question": "What's a good CTR for new channels?", "answer": "2-10% is typical, but it varies wildly by niche and traffic source. Compare to your own average rather than arbitrary benchmarks. Aim to improve over time."},
    {"question": "Why is watch time more important than views?", "answer": "YouTube's business model relies on keeping people on the platform. Videos that keep viewers watching get recommended more, regardless of total views."},
    {"question": "When should I look at advanced analytics?", "answer": "Master the basics first (watch time, CTR, subscribers). Once you're consistently posting and have a month of data, explore traffic sources and audience retention."}
