    {"question": "Do all videos need stories?", "answer": "Not dramatic narratives, but structure helps everything. Even quick tips benefit from problem-solution-benefit structure. Story thinking improves all content."},
    {"question": "How to hook in first 10 seconds?", "answer": "Show the end result, ask a provocative question, make a bold claim, or create visual surprise. Give reason to keep watching immediately."},
    {"question": "What are open loops?", "answer": "Questions or teasers that create curiosity. 'Later I'll show you the result' or 'But there's a twist.' Brain wants closure, keeps watching."},
    {"question": "How to practice storytelling?", "answer": "Study creators you admire. Note their structure. Write video outlines with story beats. Practice verbally. Analyze retention graphs for what works."}
