  "faq": [
    {"question": "What's a good engagement rate?", "answer": "2-5% is average. 5-10% is good. 10%+ is excellent. Varies by niche—smaller channels often have higher rates."},
    {"question": "Which matters more: likes or comments?", "answer": "Comments signal stronger engagement. But likes are easier to get. Both matter. Focus on encouraging comments when possible."},
    {"question": "Does engagement affect the algorithm?", "answer": "Yes, but indirectly. Engagement signals quality. High engagement often correlates with good retention, which directly affects reach."},
    {"question": "How do I get more comments?", "answer": "Ask questions. Be specific—not 'let me know what you think' but 'what's YOUR biggest challenge with X?' Make it easy to respond."}
