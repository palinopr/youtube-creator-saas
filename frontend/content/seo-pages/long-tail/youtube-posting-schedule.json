  "faq": [
    {"question": "How often should I upload?", "answer": "As often as you can sustainably. Weekly is common and effective. Daily can work but burns many out. Monthly is fine if quality is high. Consistency matters more than frequency."},
    {"question": "What's the best time to upload?", "answer": "2-3 hours before your audience's peak viewing time. Check your Analytics > Audience > When viewers are on YouTube. General rule: afternoons/evenings in your main audience timezone."},
    {"question": "Does upload time really matter?", "answer": "For initial push, somewhat. Early engagement signals quality to algorithm. Long-term, consistency matters more. A great video finds its audience regardless. Don't stress excessively about timing."},
    {"question": "Should I tell subscribers my schedule?", "answer": "Yes—predictability builds habit. Mention in videos, channel description, Community tab. Subscribers who know when to expect content are more likely to watch promptly."}
