  "faq": [
    {"question": "What's a good average view duration?", "answer": "50%+ of video length is excellent. 30-50% is good. Below 30% needs improvement. Depends on video length—8 min on a 10 min video is great."},
    {"question": "Does video length affect watch time?", "answer": "Longer videos can accumulate more total watch time, but only if retention stays high. A watched 8-minute video beats an abandoned 20-minute video."},
    {"question": "How to find retention drop-off points?", "answer": "YouTube Studio > Analytics > Engagement > Audience Retention. Shows exactly where viewers leave. Fix these moments."},
    {"question": "Do playlists help watch time?", "answer": "Yes—playlists continue session watch time. Organize content into playlists. Use playlist links in end screens and descriptions."}
