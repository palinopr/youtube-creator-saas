  "faq": [
    {"question": "Does upload time really affect views?", "answer": "Yes, but it's one factor among many. A great video at a bad time still outperforms a mediocre video at the perfect time. Optimize timing, but content quality matters more."},
    {"question": "Should I upload daily at the same time?", "answer": "Consistency helps subscribers know when to expect content. But upload frequency matters more than perfect timing. Find a sustainable schedule first."},
    {"question": "What if my audience is global?", "answer": "You can't hit everyone's peak hours. Focus on your largest audience segment. Use Analytics to find where most viewers are located."},
    {"question": "How long before peak should I upload?", "answer": "Upload 2-3 hours before peak viewing time. This allows YouTube to process, generate recommendations, and send notifications before your audience comes online."}
