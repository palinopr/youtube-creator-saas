  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long should I run each test?", "answer": "Minimum 7 days, ideally 14. Need enough impressions for statistical significance. Low-view videos need longer test periods."},
    {"question": "Does YouTube have official A/B testing?", "answer": "Yes—Test & Compare feature rolling out. Check YouTube Studio > Video > Analytics for availability. Not all channels have access yet."},
    {"question": "Can testing hurt my video?", "answer": "Short-term CTR may fluctuate. Worst case is temporary lower CTR during poor variant. Long-term benefits outweigh short-term risk."},
    {"question": "How do I know if results are significant?", "answer": "Look for 10%+ CTR difference with 1000+ impressions. Smaller differences may be noise. Use online statistical significance calculators if unsure."}
