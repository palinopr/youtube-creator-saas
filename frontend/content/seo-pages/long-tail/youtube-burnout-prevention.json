  "faq": [
    {"question": "How often should I upload?", "answer": "What you can sustain for years. Weekly is common, but bi-weekly or monthly can work. Consistency matters more than frequency. Don't compare to full-time creators if you're not."},
    {"question": "Should I take a break?", "answer": "If you're asking, probably yes. Communicate with audience, schedule break, recharge. Channel survives breaks better than burned-out creator."},
    {"question": "How to handle negative comments?", "answer": "Moderation settings, limited reading time, moderators. Don't read before bed. Block freely. Your mental health is worth more than any comment."},
    {"question": "What if my channel suffers during breaks?", "answer": "Short-term dip possible but usually recovers. Long-term burnout causes permanent quit. Taking breaks is sustainable, burning out isn't."}
