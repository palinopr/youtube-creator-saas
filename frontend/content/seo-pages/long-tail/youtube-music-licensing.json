    {"question": "Can I use popular songs?", "answer": "Almost never without issues. Even short clips get detected. Content ID finds most copyrighted music. Result is usually monetization by rights holder. Best to use licensed music."},
    {"question": "Is YouTube Audio Library good?", "answer": "Yes—completely free and safe. Limited selection compared to paid services. Quality varies. Good for starting out. Many creators upgrade to paid libraries eventually."},
    {"question": "What about copyright-free claims?", "answer": "Creators sometimes claim 'copyright-free' incorrectly. Always verify actual license. Free doesn't always mean unrestricted. Read terms. Keep documentation. Trust established sources."},
    {"question": "Do I need music in videos?", "answer": "Not always—some content works better without. Silence or minimal music is valid choice. Don't add music just because. Consider if music adds or distracts. Test with audience."}
