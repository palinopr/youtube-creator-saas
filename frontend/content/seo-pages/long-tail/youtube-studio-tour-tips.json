  "faq": [
    {"question": "How much space do I need?", "answer": "6x6 feet minimum for talking head. More for standing or movement. Even a closet works for voiceover. Corner of room with controlled background sufficient for most content."},
    {"question": "How much should I spend on studio?", "answer": "Start with $200-500: basic lights, backdrop, acoustic treatment. Upgrade gradually. Many successful creators started with near-nothing. Invest in audio first, lighting second."},
    {"question": "How to handle small spaces?", "answer": "Tight shots hide small spaces. Use depth with diagonal shooting. Mirrors can create illusion of space. Minimalist backgrounds work well. Small can look intentional if designed well."},
    {"question": "Dedicated room or shared space?", "answer": "Dedicated ideal for efficiency—always ready. Shared space works with good organization—document setup to recreate. Rolling carts help with portable studios. Many successful creators share space."}
