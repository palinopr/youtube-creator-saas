  "faq": [
    {"question": "How many hashtags should I use?", "answer": "3-5 maximum. YouTube officially recommends no more than 15. More than 5 looks spammy. Less is more."},
    {"question": "Do hashtags really help?", "answer": "Minor impact at best. Title, thumbnail, and content quality matter far more. Hashtags are supplementary, not primary."},
    {"question": "Should I put hashtags in title?", "answer": "No—looks unprofessional. Put in description. First 3 automatically appear above title anyway."},
    {"question": "What happens with too many hashtags?", "answer": "YouTube may ignore all of them. Over 15 can trigger spam detection. Stick to 3-5 relevant ones."}
