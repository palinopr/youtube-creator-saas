  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long does 1000 subscribers take?", "answer": "Varies wildly—3 months to 2+ years depending on niche, content quality, and consistency. Average is 12-18 months. Some viral channels hit it in weeks."},
    {"question": "Should I buy subscribers?", "answer": "Absolutely not. Fake subscribers don't watch, destroying your engagement rate. YouTube can detect and penalize. Kills channel long-term."},
    {"question": "What if growth stalls?", "answer": "Analyze what's working—double down on successful topics. Improve thumbnails and titles. Try different content types. The plateau is normal."},
    {"question": "Is niche more important than quality?", "answer": "Both matter, but niche first. Perfect videos in oversaturated niches struggle. Good videos in underserved niches grow. Find your gap."}
