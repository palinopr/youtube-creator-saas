  "faq": [
    {"question": "Absolute minimum to start?", "answer": "Phone + free editing software + natural light. Add $30 mic when possible. That's genuinely enough to create good content."},
    {"question": "Should I buy camera or phone gimbal?", "answer": "Neither initially. Tripod or phone mount more useful. Stabilization can be added in software. Invest in audio first."},
    {"question": "When to upgrade from phone?", "answer": "When you've made 50+ videos and know exactly what you need. Most creators upgrade too early. Master what you have first."},
    {"question": "Best budget upgrade?", "answer": "Almost always audio. $100 on better mic/interface beats $500 on camera. Viewers tolerate mediocre video; bad audio makes them leave."}
