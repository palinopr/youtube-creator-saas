  "faq": [
    {"question": "Face or logo for profile picture?", "answer": "Face usually performs better—humans connect with faces. Logos work for brands, gaming channels, anonymous creators. Whatever you choose, make sure it's recognizable at thumbnail comment-size."},
    {"question": "How often should I rebrand?", "answer": "Rarely—consistency builds recognition. Update gradually if needed. Major rebrands can confuse audience. Only rebrand if current branding doesn't represent you or is holding you back."},
    {"question": "What colors work best?", "answer": "Bright, saturated colors stand out in feeds. Blues and reds are popular but common. Choose colors that represent your content energy. Test thumbnail visibility against competitors."},
    {"question": "Should thumbnails all look the same?", "answer": "Consistent style, not identical. Same fonts, colors, composition patterns—but each thumbnail unique to its content. Balance recognizability with visual variety."}
