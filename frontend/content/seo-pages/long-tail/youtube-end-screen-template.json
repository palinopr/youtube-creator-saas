  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long should end screens be?", "answer": "10-20 seconds is ideal. Long enough for viewers to click, short enough not to tank retention. 5 seconds minimum is too short."},
    {"question": "Should I use 'best for viewer' or specific videos?", "answer": "Mix both. 'Best for viewer' lets YouTube optimize. Specific videos work for series or related content. Test what works."},
    {"question": "Do end screens hurt retention?", "answer": "Yes, slightly. Viewers who leave during end screen count against average view duration. But the trade-off for continued viewing is worth it."},
    {"question": "Can I add end screens after uploading?", "answer": "Yes. Add or edit end screens anytime in YouTube Studio. You can also apply end screen templates across multiple videos."}
