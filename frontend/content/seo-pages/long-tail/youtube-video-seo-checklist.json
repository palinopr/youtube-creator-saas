  "faq": [
    {"question": "How important is video SEO really?", "answer": "For searchable content, critical—determines if you get found. For browse content, less direct but still matters. YouTube uses all metadata to understand and categorize your video. Every bit helps."},
    {"question": "Should I update old video SEO?", "answer": "Yes—especially underperformers with high impressions, low CTR. Update thumbnails and titles. Fresh descriptions with current keywords. Videos can resurge with optimization."},
    {"question": "How long until SEO shows results?", "answer": "Search ranking can take days to weeks. Some videos rank quickly for low-competition terms. High-competition keywords take longer. Consistency across videos compounds over months."},
    {"question": "Can I over-optimize?", "answer": "Yes—keyword stuffing looks spammy and turns off viewers. Write for humans first. If it sounds unnatural, it's over-optimized. YouTube's AI is smart; natural language works."}
