    {"question": "Is sub4sub worth it?", "answer": "Never. Kills your channel metrics. YouTube's algorithm notices low engagement. Hurts recommendations long-term."},
    {"question": "When to start promoting?", "answer": "After 5-10 quality videos minimum. Don't promote empty channel. Give new visitors content to binge."}
