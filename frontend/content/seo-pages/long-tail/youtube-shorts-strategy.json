  "faq": [
    {"question": "Do Shorts hurt long-form performance?", "answer": "Generally no—they're separate audiences initially. Shorts can introduce new viewers to your channel. Some may convert to long-form subscribers. Key is quality in both formats. Don't sacrifice long-form for Shorts."},
    {"question": "How often should I post Shorts?", "answer": "More is generally better for testing. Daily posting common for serious growth. Quality still matters—but Shorts forgive imperfection. 3-5 per week minimum for consistent presence. Test volume and see what's sustainable."},
    {"question": "Can I monetize Shorts?", "answer": "Yes—Shorts Fund replaced by RPM monetization. Ad revenue now shared on Shorts. Lower per-view than long-form but volume compensates. Need to be in YPP. Monetization based on views in Shorts feed."},
    {"question": "Repurpose or create native Shorts?", "answer": "Both work. Repurposing is efficient—clip best moments from long-form. Native Shorts can be more optimized for format. Many successful channels do both. Test what your audience responds to."}
