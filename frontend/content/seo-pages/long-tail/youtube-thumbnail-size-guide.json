  "faq": [
    {"question": "Can I use higher resolution?", "answer": "Yes, but it will be scaled down. 1920x1080 works well—same aspect ratio, sharper source. YouTube compresses all thumbnails."},
    {"question": "Why is my thumbnail blurry?", "answer": "Either source resolution too low, heavy JPEG compression, or too much fine detail. Use PNG for text, ensure 1280x720 minimum."},
    {"question": "GIF thumbnails work?", "answer": "YouTube accepts GIF format but displays as static image. No animated thumbnails allowed currently."},
    {"question": "Best format for quality?", "answer": "PNG for graphics and text, JPG for photos. PNG is lossless but larger files. JPG compresses more."}
