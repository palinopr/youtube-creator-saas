  "faq": [
    {"question": "When can I get sponsorships?", "answer": "Technically any size—brands care about fit and engagement. Most sponsors want 10K+ subscribers minimum. Niche channels get sponsors earlier. Micro-influencers (10K-100K) often have better engagement rates."},
    {"question": "How much should I charge?", "answer": "Common starting point: $20-50 per 1000 views (CPM). Dedicated videos worth more than integrations. Niche matters—finance, tech pay more. Always negotiate—first offer rarely best."},
    {"question": "How to find sponsors?", "answer": "Join platforms: Grapevine, Aspire, CreatorIQ. Email brands you use directly. Media kit helps. As you grow, sponsors find you. Initial outreach is hustle but necessary."},
    {"question": "Should I take every sponsorship?", "answer": "No—protect your audience trust. Reject products you don't believe in. Bad sponsorships hurt credibility and engagement. Better to decline than damage audience relationship. Long-term thinking wins."}
