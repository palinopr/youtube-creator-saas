  "faq": [
    {"question": "Can faceless channels succeed?", "answer": "Absolutely—many massive channels are faceless. Bright Side, Kurzgesagt, countless tutorial channels. Some niches work better than others. Value matters more than face time."},
    {"question": "What about AI voiceover?", "answer": "Improving rapidly and acceptable in some niches. Real voice typically performs better for engagement. AI voiceover works for certain automation channels. Test with your audience."},
    {"question": "Is faceless content harder to grow?", "answer": "Different, not necessarily harder. Personality-driven growth is different from value-driven. Faceless channels often grow through search/recommendations rather than subscriber loyalty. Both paths work."},
    {"question": "Should I stay anonymous forever?", "answer": "Your choice. Many reveal face later as channel grows. Some stay faceless permanently. You can always transition—harder to go from face to faceless. Start where comfortable."}
