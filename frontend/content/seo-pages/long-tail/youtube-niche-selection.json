  "faq": [
    {"question": "Can I change niches later?", "answer": "Yes, but it's hard. Existing audience may leave. Better to sub-niche or expand gradually. Choose wisely upfront."},
    {"question": "How specific should my niche be?", "answer": "Specific enough to stand out, broad enough to sustain content. 'Tech reviews' is too broad. 'Budget Android phones' is better."},
    {"question": "What niches make most money?", "answer": "Finance, business, tech, health have high CPMs. But competition is fierce. Balance earning potential with achievability."},
    {"question": "Should I follow passion or profit?", "answer": "Both matter. Passion sustains you through hard times. Profit validates demand. Find overlap."}
