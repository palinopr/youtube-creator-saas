    {"question": "What's a good impression count?", "answer": "Varies wildly by channel size. Focus on trend direction and CTR percentage rather than absolute numbers. More impressions over time = growth."},
    {"question": "Why are my impressions low?", "answer": "New channel, low CTR on previous videos, or content not matching audience. Improve thumbnails/titles, post consistently, and be patient."},
    {"question": "Can I get impressions from external traffic?", "answer": "External views don't count as impressions but can signal to YouTube your content is valuable, potentially increasing in-platform impressions."},
    {"question": "Why does CTR drop over time?", "answer": "Initial impressions go to subscribers (high CTR). As video expands to new audiences, CTR naturally drops. This is normal and healthy."}
