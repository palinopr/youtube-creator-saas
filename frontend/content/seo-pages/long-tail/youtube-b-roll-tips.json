    {"question": "Where to get stock B-roll?", "answer": "Paid: Artgrid, Storyblocks, Envato. Free: Pexels, Pixabay. YouTube offers some in Create. Build own library over time. Quality matters—cheap stock looks cheap."},
    {"question": "How much B-roll per video?", "answer": "Varies by style—some channels use heavily, others minimally. 20-40% B-roll coverage common for talking head content. Match your niche expectations. Don't force it where not needed."},
    {"question": "Can I use other YouTube videos as B-roll?", "answer": "Not without permission—copyright issue. Using small clips may be fair use for commentary/criticism but risky. Stock footage or original always safer. Some creators license to others."},
    {"question": "Tips for filming own B-roll?", "answer": "Film extra during any shoot. Keep camera rolling between takes. Capture hands doing tasks. Get establishing shots. Movement adds interest. Build library—future videos benefit."}
