  "faq": [
    {"question": "Does repurposing hurt original video?", "answer": "No—different platforms, different audiences. Clips can drive traffic to long-form. YouTube doesn't penalize for having content elsewhere."},
    {"question": "How many Shorts from one video?", "answer": "Depends on content length. 10-20 minute video might yield 3-5 good Shorts. Don't force it—only clip genuinely strong moments."},
    {"question": "Should I post same clip everywhere?", "answer": "Mostly yes. Each platform has different audience. Adjust aspect ratio and captions for platform conventions. Same content, platform-optimized."},
    {"question": "Best tool for clip creation?", "answer": "CapCut, Opus Clip (AI-based), or manual editing in your NLE. AI tools speed up but miss context. Manual gives more control."}
