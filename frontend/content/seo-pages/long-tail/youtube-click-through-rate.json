  "faq": [
    {"question": "What's a good CTR?", "answer": "4-5% is average, 6-8% is good, 10%+ is excellent. Varies by source—browse CTR is lower than search CTR. Compare your videos to each other, not to arbitrary benchmarks."},
    {"question": "Why does my CTR vary so much?", "answer": "CTR depends on impression source. Search impressions have higher CTR. As videos age and reach broader audience, CTR often drops. New video CTR to subscribers is naturally higher."},
    {"question": "How to A/B test thumbnails?", "answer": "YouTube has built-in A/B testing for larger channels. Manually test by changing thumbnail and monitoring CTR over a week. Give enough time for data to be meaningful. Test one element at a time."},
    {"question": "Clickbait vs curiosity?", "answer": "Clickbait promises what video doesn't deliver—damages retention and trust. Curiosity creates intrigue that video satisfies. Aim for compelling truth, not misleading hype. Retention reveals if you're delivering."}
