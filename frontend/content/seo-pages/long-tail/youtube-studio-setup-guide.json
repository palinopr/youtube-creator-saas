    {"question": "How much space do I need?", "answer": "6x6 feet minimum for talking head. Larger for product reviews or movement. Ceiling height matters for lighting. Work with what you have—great content made in closets. Optimize your space."},
    {"question": "What to prioritize first?", "answer": "Audio treatment often more impactful than camera upgrade. Then lighting. Camera last—decent cameras with good light and sound outperform great cameras with bad audio. Budget accordingly."},
    {"question": "How to soundproof on a budget?", "answer": "Moving blankets are cheap absorption. Carpets and curtains help. Record during quiet times. Closets with clothes = free sound treatment. Foam panels later. Perfect isn't required."},
    {"question": "DIY or buy studio furniture?", "answer": "Both work—IKEA desks popular for budget setups. Custom builds fit exactly. Start with what you have, upgrade as you understand needs. Permanent installations after you know what works."}
