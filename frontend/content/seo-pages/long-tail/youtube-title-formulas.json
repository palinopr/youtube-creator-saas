  "faq": [
    {"question": "What title length is best?", "answer": "Under 60 characters displays fully in most places. Front-load key info since truncation happens. Shorter often better—punchier, more readable. Long titles can work but risky."},
    {"question": "Should titles include keywords?", "answer": "Yes—for searchable content. Near beginning is best for SEO. Don't force awkwardly. Browse content can be more creative; search content needs keywords."},
    {"question": "How important are numbers in titles?", "answer": "Very effective—numbers are specific and scannable. '7 Tips' outperforms 'Tips'. Odd numbers tend to perform slightly better than even. Specific numbers (347%) beat round numbers."},
    {"question": "Is ALL CAPS clickbait?", "answer": "One or two CAPS words for emphasis is fine. Full caps titles look spammy. YouTube doesn't penalize but viewers may. Strategic caps on key word can improve CTR."}
