  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long should hooks be?", "answer": "5-30 seconds depending on content. Capture attention in first 5, complete hook by 30. Shorter is generally better. Get to value fast—you can expand after you've hooked them."},
    {"question": "Should I skip channel intros?", "answer": "Yes—save branding for after hook. Viewers don't care who you are until you've given value. Long intros kill retention. Introduce yourself briefly after hook if at all."},
    {"question": "How to practice hooks?", "answer": "Study retention graphs—where do people leave? Test different hook types. Watch successful creators in your niche. Write multiple hooks per video, choose best. Iterate based on data."},
    {"question": "Can hooks be too clickbaity?", "answer": "Hook must deliver on promise. Clickbait = promise without delivery. Strong hook + great content = success. Strong hook + weak content = viewers leave and won't return."}
