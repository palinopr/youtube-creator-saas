    {"question": "Can I use a different aspect ratio?", "answer": "You can upload other ratios, but YouTube will add black bars or crop to fit 16:9. For best results, design at 16:9 from the start."},
    {"question": "What's the minimum thumbnail size?", "answer": "Minimum width is 640 pixels. But always use 1280x720 for sharp display on all devices including TVs."},
    {"question": "PNG or JPG for thumbnails?", "answer": "PNG for graphics, text overlays, and transparent elements. JPG for photographic thumbnails with many colors."},
    {"question": "Why does my thumbnail look blurry?", "answer": "Usually compression from uploading a low-resolution image. Always design at 1280x720, export at high quality, and check file size."}
