  "faq": [
    {"question": "How much research before filming?", "answer": "At minimum: check autocomplete, look at top 5 videos for topic, read comments. Can be 15 minutes. Deep research for important topics might be hours. Always some research—never just guess."},
    {"question": "What makes a good topic?", "answer": "High search demand, achievable competition, fits your niche, you can deliver value. Best topics have demand but aren't dominated by huge channels. Look for 'goldilocks' opportunities."},
    {"question": "How to find gaps in content?", "answer": "Comments asking questions not answered. Old videos ranking (audience wants fresh). Related topics with no good videos. Your unique angle on common topic. Specific variations of broad topics."},
    {"question": "Should I only make researched content?", "answer": "Research should inform most content. But passion projects and experiments valuable too. 70% research-backed, 30% creative exploration reasonable balance. Data + creativity = best results."}
