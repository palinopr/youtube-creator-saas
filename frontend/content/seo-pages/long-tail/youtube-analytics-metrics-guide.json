    {"question": "Most important YouTube metric?", "answer": "Watch time—YouTube's stated priority. But CTR and retention together matter most for recommendations. High CTR with low retention hurts you. Moderate CTR with great retention wins long-term."},
    {"question": "What's a good CTR?", "answer": "Channel-dependent, but 4-10% typical for most. Higher on subscribers' feeds, lower on Browse. Compare to your own averages. 2% on Browse can still drive millions of views with volume."},
    {"question": "RPM vs CPM—what's the difference?", "answer": "CPM is what advertisers pay YouTube per 1000 impressions. RPM is what YOU receive per 1000 views after YouTube's 45% cut and non-monetized views factored. RPM is your actual revenue metric."},
    {"question": "Why do metrics fluctuate?", "answer": "Normal—audience behavior varies by day, season, and content. New videos take time to stabilize. YouTube experiments with recommending to different audiences. Focus on trends over weeks, not days."}
