    {"question": "Will uploading more grow my channel faster?", "answer": "Not necessarily. Uploading more low-quality content hurts you. One great video beats three mediocre ones. Quality earns algorithm favor."},
    {"question": "Does upload time matter?", "answer": "Minimal impact on algorithm. Matters more for live notifications to active subscribers. Upload when it fits your workflow."},
    {"question": "What if I miss a scheduled upload?", "answer": "Not catastrophic. Communicate if you have loyal audience. The algorithm doesn't 'punish' gaps. Quality matters more than perfect consistency."},
    {"question": "How do successful creators upload daily?", "answer": "Teams, simpler formats, batching, and experience. They've optimized workflows over years. Don't compare your start to their current state."}
