  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long until I see growth?", "answer": "Varies wildly—3 months to 2+ years for meaningful traction. Focus on improvement, not timeline. Consistency and quality eventually compound."},
    {"question": "Should I do Shorts?", "answer": "Yes for reach, but don't rely solely on them. Shorts subscribers often don't watch long-form. Use Shorts to attract, long-form to convert."},
    {"question": "Is my niche too small?", "answer": "Probably not. Small niches are easier to dominate. Better to be #1 in tiny niche than #10,000 in huge one. Expand later."},
    {"question": "When should I quit my day job?", "answer": "Not until you have 6+ months of living expenses saved from YouTube. Monetization takes time. Keep stable income while building."}
