    {"question": "Does engagement help the algorithm?", "answer": "Yes—engagement signals content quality. Comments especially valuable. But watch time and retention matter more. Engagement complements good content, doesn't replace it."},
    {"question": "How to get more comments?", "answer": "Ask specific questions, not just 'comment below.' Respond to early comments to spark discussion. Feature commenters in videos. Create debates/discussions. Make commenting feel valuable."},
    {"question": "Should I respond to all comments?", "answer": "As many as possible when small. Quality responses when large. At scale, prioritize: questions, new viewers, regulars. Heart comments you can't reply to. Presence matters."},
    {"question": "What about negative comments?", "answer": "Genuine criticism: consider and respond thoughtfully. Trolls: ignore or delete. Don't engage with bad faith comments—it encourages more. Build positive community culture."}
