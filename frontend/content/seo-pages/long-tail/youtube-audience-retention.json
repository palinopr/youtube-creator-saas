  "faq": [
    {"question": "What's a good retention rate?", "answer": "Depends on video length—50%+ for 10-minute videos is solid. Shorter videos should have higher retention. Compare to YOUR averages, not others. Trending up is what matters. Industry averages vary widely."},
    {"question": "Where do viewers typically drop off?", "answer": "First 30 seconds sees biggest drop—if you don't hook quickly. Long intros lose people. Slow segments mid-video. Right before end if you've signaled video is ending. Study your specific patterns."},
    {"question": "How do pattern interrupts work?", "answer": "Changes in visual or audio prevent viewer fatigue. B-roll, graphics, angle changes, music shifts. Every 30-60 seconds works well. Doesn't need to be dramatic—subtle changes keep brain engaged."},
    {"question": "Should I make shorter videos?", "answer": "Not necessarily—longer videos can have great retention if engaging throughout. Problem is filler, not length. Make videos as long as they need to be. Retention per minute matters more than total retention."}
