  "faq": [
    {"question": "How often should I check analytics?", "answer": "Weekly for strategic review. Daily checking creates anxiety without actionable insights. Data needs time to accumulate. Set specific review day/time. Resist urge to constantly refresh."},
    {"question": "What's the most important metric?", "answer": "Depends on goals. Watch time for algorithm favor. CTR for thumbnail/title optimization. Retention for content quality. Revenue if monetized. Focus on one or two, not everything."},
    {"question": "Why do numbers differ from public view count?", "answer": "Analytics updates differently than public counts. Some views filtered for spam/bots. Real-time tab shows immediate data. Overview shows verified data. Both are accurate for different purposes."},
    {"question": "How to export YouTube analytics?", "answer": "Advanced mode in Analytics allows exports. Download as CSV or Google Sheets. Useful for deeper analysis or tracking over time. Compare to other data sources for full picture."}
