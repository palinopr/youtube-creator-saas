    {"question": "Should I focus on one format?", "answer": "Most successful channels do both. Shorts for reach, long-form for revenue and loyalty. Pure Shorts channels struggle with monetization."},
    {"question": "Do Shorts subscribers watch long-form?", "answer": "Often not—they're different behaviors. Don't expect Shorts audience to fully convert. Build both audiences."},
    {"question": "Which pays more?", "answer": "Long-form significantly. Shorts Fund pays less than ad revenue on similar view counts. Long-form with mid-rolls is best for revenue."},
    {"question": "Can I repurpose content between formats?", "answer": "Yes—clip best moments from long-form for Shorts. Design some long-form content with clips in mind. Efficient content strategy."}
