  "faq": [
    {"question": "Do I need professional design?", "answer": "No—Canva is sufficient for most. Consistency matters more than complexity. Clean and simple beats elaborate and inconsistent."},
    {"question": "How often update branding?", "answer": "Rarely change core elements. Update banner for seasons/milestones. Major rebrands only when necessary. Consistency builds recognition."},
    {"question": "Best colors for YouTube thumbnails?", "answer": "Contrast with YouTube's white/red. Yellow, blue, green pop. Avoid red unless intentional. Test what works in your niche."},
    {"question": "Does branding affect algorithm?", "answer": "Indirectly—recognizable thumbnails get more clicks from subscribers. Brand recognition increases CTR. Algorithm notices click patterns."}
