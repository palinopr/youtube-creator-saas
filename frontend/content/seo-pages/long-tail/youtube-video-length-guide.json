  "faq": [
    {"question": "Does length affect algorithm ranking?", "answer": "Indirectly. YouTube values watch time and satisfaction. Longer videos can generate more watch time if people watch. But a boring 20-minute video hurts you."},
    {"question": "What's the minimum for monetization?", "answer": "8 minutes to place mid-roll ads. There's no minimum for end cards. Shorter videos can still earn from pre-roll and display ads."},
    {"question": "Should I make videos longer for more ads?", "answer": "Only if content quality stays high. Viewers who feel videos are padded lose trust. One engaged viewer beats ten who leave early."},
    {"question": "Are shorter videos getting more popular?", "answer": "Shorts are growing, but long-form isn't dying. Different content serves different needs. Many creators succeed with 15-30+ minute videos."}
