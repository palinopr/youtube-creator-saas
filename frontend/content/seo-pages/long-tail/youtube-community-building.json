    {"question": "How long to build a community?", "answer": "Meaningful community takes 1-2 years of consistent effort. Early signs appear sooner—returning commenters, inside jokes forming. Don't rush it."},
    {"question": "Should I create a Discord server?", "answer": "Only if you'll actively moderate and participate. Empty/ignored Discords hurt more than help. Start when you have engaged core audience."},
    {"question": "How to handle negative community members?", "answer": "Set clear expectations. Moderate fairly but firmly. Block truly toxic members. Your community reflects the culture you allow."},
    {"question": "Can you buy community?", "answer": "No—fake engagement hurts more than helps. Real community builds through genuine connection over time. No shortcuts exist."}
