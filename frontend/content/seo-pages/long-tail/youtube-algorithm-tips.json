  "faq": [
    {"question": "Can you beat the algorithm?", "answer": "Wrong framing—work WITH it. Algorithm wants to show viewers content they'll enjoy. Make content viewers love, metrics follow, recommendations come. No tricks substitute for quality."},
    {"question": "Does posting time matter?", "answer": "Somewhat—post when your audience is online. Analytics shows when subscribers watch. But great content performs regardless. Consistency of schedule matters more than specific time."},
    {"question": "Why did my video stop getting views?", "answer": "Videos have lifecycles. Initial push tests CTR and retention. If metrics strong, continues. If weak, impressions slow. Evergreen content can resurge months later. New videos get new chances."},
    {"question": "Do hashtags and tags help?", "answer": "Minimal impact on algorithm. Metadata helps categorization slightly. Title, thumbnail, and retention matter far more. Don't obsess over tags—focus on content quality."}
