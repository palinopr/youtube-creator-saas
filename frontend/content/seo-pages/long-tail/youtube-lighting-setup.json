  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best budget lighting option?", "answer": "Natural window light is free and excellent. For artificial, Neewer softbox kits under $100 work well. Single good light beats multiple cheap ones. Start simple, upgrade as needed."},
    {"question": "Ring light or softbox?", "answer": "Softbox more flattering for most—soft, natural look. Ring lights distinctive but can look artificial. Ring lights good for beauty, softbox better for general content. Both work."},
    {"question": "How to light with one light?", "answer": "Place single softbox at 45° angle to face. Use white wall or reflector opposite to fill shadows. Position near window for combined effect. One good light can work great."},
    {"question": "Does lighting matter that much?", "answer": "More than camera quality in most cases. Well-lit phone footage beats poorly-lit expensive camera. Lighting is first upgrade recommendation for improving video quality. Worth the investment."}
