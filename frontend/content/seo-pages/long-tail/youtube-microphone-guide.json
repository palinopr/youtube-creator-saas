    {"question": "Best budget microphone for YouTube?", "answer": "Fifine K669 or similar USB mics under $50 are surprisingly good. Blue Snowball at $50-70 classic choice. Rode NT-USB Mini excellent mid-range. Start budget, upgrade when warranted."},
    {"question": "USB or XLR microphone?", "answer": "USB simpler—plug into computer and go. XLR higher quality ceiling but needs audio interface. Most YouTubers fine with USB. XLR for podcasts, voiceover, professional work."},
    {"question": "How to reduce echo and room noise?", "answer": "Record in smaller room if possible. Soft furnishings absorb sound—carpets, curtains, furniture help. Foam panels on walls effective. Closets make great vocal booths. Blankets work in a pinch."},
    {"question": "Why does my audio sound bad?", "answer": "Common issues: mic too far away, gain too high causing distortion, room echo, handling noise. Get mic closer, lower gain, treat room, use shock mount. Most problems are setup not gear."}
