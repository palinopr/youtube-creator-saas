  "faq": [
    {"question": "What's a good average view duration?", "answer": "50%+ of video length is solid. 70%+ is excellent. But context matters—a 50% on 20 minutes beats 80% on 3 minutes in total watch time."},
    {"question": "Why do viewers leave in the first 30 seconds?", "answer": "Usually weak hooks, mismatched expectations, or slow starts. Your intro must immediately validate the click and promise value."},
    {"question": "Should I make shorter videos for better retention?", "answer": "Not necessarily. Shorter videos have higher percentage retention but less total watch time. Make videos as long as they need to be—no longer."},
    {"question": "Do pattern interrupts really help?", "answer": "Yes. Visual changes every 10-30 seconds keep attention. B-roll, graphics, camera angle changes, and zoom effects all help."}
