    {"question": "What camera should I use?", "answer": "Your phone is fine to start. iPhone/modern Android phones shoot great video. Upgrade to mirrorless when phone limits you. Technique matters more than gear. Master basics first."},
    {"question": "How to look good on camera?", "answer": "Eye-level camera angle is most flattering. Good lighting hides flaws. Look at the lens, not the screen. Relax shoulders. Practice until comfortable. Everyone improves with repetition."},
    {"question": "Film in 4K or 1080p?", "answer": "4K if storage and computer can handle it—allows cropping and future-proofing. 1080p perfectly acceptable for YouTube and easier to work with. Either works well."},
    {"question": "How many takes should I film?", "answer": "At least 2-3 takes of important segments. More for difficult deliveries. Review between takes. Better to have options in editing. Extra footage is never wasted."}
