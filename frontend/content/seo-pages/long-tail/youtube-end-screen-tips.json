  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long should end screens be?", "answer": "15-20 seconds is optimal. Minimum 5 seconds required. Longer than 20 seconds feels like filler. Design your outro to naturally fit end screen duration."},
    {"question": "Best for viewer or specific video?", "answer": "'Best for viewer' lets algorithm choose based on individual viewer behavior—often performs well. Specific video if you want strategic traffic. Test both and check Analytics."},
    {"question": "Should I always include subscribe button?", "answer": "Generally yes—every video is subscribe opportunity. But prioritize keeping them watching. Video element usually more valuable than subscribe if choosing only one."},
    {"question": "Why aren't people clicking end screens?", "answer": "Common issues: not verbally calling attention to them, elements not visible against background, viewers leaving before end screen, not relevant video suggestions. Check where retention drops off."}
