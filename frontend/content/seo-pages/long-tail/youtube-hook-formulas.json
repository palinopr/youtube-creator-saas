  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long should a hook be?", "answer": "5-15 seconds for the hook phase. First 5 seconds most critical—this is where most drop-off happens. Get to value quickly after hook."},
    {"question": "Do I need a new hook every video?", "answer": "Formulas work repeatedly—viewers don't mind familiar structures. Content of hook changes, pattern can repeat. Consistency is fine."},
    {"question": "What if my topic is boring?", "answer": "No topic is boring with right hook. Focus on transformation, outcome, or counterintuitive angle. Find what makes it matter to viewer."},
    {"question": "Should hook match thumbnail?", "answer": "Yes—if thumbnail promises something, hook should deliver on or expand that promise. Mismatch causes immediate drop-off."}
