  "faq": [
    {"question": "Does the algorithm punish new channels?", "answer": "No, but new channels lack the viewer history signals that established channels have. The algorithm tests new content with small audiences first, regardless of channel size."},
    {"question": "How long until a video gets picked up?", "answer": "Videos can get recommended months or years after upload if they satisfy viewer needs. Evergreen content can have multiple growth phases."},
    {"question": "Does changing titles/thumbnails reset the algorithm?", "answer": "No reset, but can trigger re-evaluation. If the new version improves CTR and watch time, performance can improve."},
    {"question": "Why do some low-quality videos go viral?", "answer": "The algorithm measures viewer behavior, not our judgment of quality. If viewers click, watch, and engage, the algorithm promotes it."}
