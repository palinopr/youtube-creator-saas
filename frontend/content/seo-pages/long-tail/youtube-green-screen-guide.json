  "faq": [
    {"question": "Green or blue screen?", "answer": "Green most common—works well for most situations. Blue better for blonde hair and outdoor scenes. Green requires less light. Most YouTube creators use green successfully."},
    {"question": "What causes bad green screen?", "answer": "Usually uneven lighting, wrinkles in screen, subject too close (green spill), or poor keying settings. Good recording makes keying easy. Bad recording makes keying impossible."},
    {"question": "Best budget green screen?", "answer": "Elgato collapsible screens popular and easy. Muslin fabric works but needs ironing. Paper backdrop wrinkles. Even cheap green screen works if lit properly."},
    {"question": "What software for chroma key?", "answer": "Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve (free), Final Cut Pro all have good chroma key. OBS can do real-time keying for streaming. Most modern editors handle basic keying well."}
