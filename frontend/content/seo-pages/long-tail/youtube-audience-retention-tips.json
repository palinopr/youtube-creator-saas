    {"question": "What's a good audience retention rate?", "answer": "50%+ is solid, 60%+ is excellent, 70%+ is exceptional. Compare to your own previous videos more than external benchmarks. Improvement is what matters."},
    {"question": "How to find retention drop-off points?", "answer": "YouTube Studio > Analytics > Engagement > Audience retention. Graph shows exactly where viewers leave. Steep drops indicate problems at those timestamps."},
    {"question": "Does video length affect retention?", "answer": "Longer videos typically have lower percentage retention but can have higher total watch time. Make videos as long as the content requires—no longer, no shorter."},
    {"question": "How quickly can I improve retention?", "answer": "Implement one technique per video. Compare retention graphs. Meaningful improvement takes 5-10 videos of consistent effort. Don't expect overnight change."}
