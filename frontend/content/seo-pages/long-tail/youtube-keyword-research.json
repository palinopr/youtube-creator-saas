    {"question": "How do I know if a keyword is too competitive?", "answer": "Check who ranks for it. If top results are all huge channels, look for longer-tail variations. VidIQ and TubeBuddy provide competition scores."},
    {"question": "Are tags still important for YouTube SEO?", "answer": "Less than before, but still worth using. Put primary keyword first, add variations. Don't expect tags alone to drive discovery."},
    {"question": "Should I optimize for Google or YouTube search?", "answer": "Both. YouTube videos appear in Google search results. Focus on YouTube search intent first, but Google-friendly titles help with external discovery."},
    {"question": "How many keywords should I target per video?", "answer": "One primary keyword, 2-3 secondary variations. Don't keyword stuff. Create content that thoroughly covers the topic naturally."}
