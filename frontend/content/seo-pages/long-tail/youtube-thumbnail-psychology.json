  "faq": [
    {"question": "Why do faces work so well?", "answer": "Evolution—humans are wired to notice and read faces. We process faces faster than other images. Emotional expressions trigger mirror neurons. Eye contact creates connection. It's instinctual, not learned."},
    {"question": "What's the curiosity gap?", "answer": "Showing enough to intrigue but not enough to satisfy. Viewer must click to complete the information. 'You won't believe what happened' creates gap. Answer in video, not thumbnail. Don't give everything away."},
    {"question": "Best colors for thumbnails?", "answer": "Yellow and red attract attention fastest (evolutionary—danger/fruit). Blue is calming and trustworthy. Green less common, stands out. Consider your niche and competitor colors. Contrast matters more than specific colors."},
    {"question": "How to test thumbnail psychology?", "answer": "A/B test with YouTube's built-in tool. Watch CTR changes. Ask community which draws attention. Step back and view at small size. Check what's working for top creators in your niche."}
