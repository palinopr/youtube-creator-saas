  "faq": [
    {"question": "How far ahead should I plan?", "answer": "Minimum 4 weeks, ideally 8-12. Gives time to research, script, film, edit without rushing. Include buffer weeks. The further ahead, the less last-minute stress."},
    {"question": "What if I miss my schedule?", "answer": "Happens to everyone. Communicate with audience if needed. Don't abandon calendar—adjust and continue. One miss isn't failure; giving up on planning is."},
    {"question": "How often should I post?", "answer": "Quality over quantity. Once per week is common baseline. More frequent only if you can maintain quality. Consistency matters more than frequency—whatever you can sustain."},
    {"question": "Should I plan specific topics or just dates?", "answer": "Both—date without topic creates stress. Have working titles even if they change. Bank of backup ideas helps fill gaps. More detailed planning = smoother production."}
