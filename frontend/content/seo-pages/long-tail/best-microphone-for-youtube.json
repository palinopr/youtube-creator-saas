    {"question": "USB or XLR microphone?", "answer": "USB for simplicity and lower cost. XLR for professional quality and flexibility. If you're starting out, USB is fine. XLR when you want to upgrade your whole audio chain."},
    {"question": "What's the best budget YouTube microphone?", "answer": "The Fifine K669B or Maono AU-A04 are surprisingly good under $50. The Audio-Technica ATR2100x around $80 is excellent value with both USB and XLR."},
    {"question": "Do I need a boom arm?", "answer": "Highly recommended. Boom arms position the mic correctly, reduce desk vibrations, and free up desk space. Budget $30-100 for a decent arm."},
    {"question": "Why does my mic pick up keyboard sounds?", "answer": "You likely need a dynamic mic (rejects room noise) or better positioning. Keep mic close to mouth, keyboard away from mic. Noise gates in software help too."}
