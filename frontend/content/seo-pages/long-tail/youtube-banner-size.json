    {"question": "Why does my banner get cropped?", "answer": "YouTube displays different areas based on device. Only the center 1546 x 423 pixels show on mobile. Design with this safe zone in mind."},
    {"question": "What resolution should my banner be?", "answer": "Minimum 2048 x 1152, recommended 2560 x 1440 pixels. Higher resolution ensures sharp display on TVs and large monitors."},
    {"question": "Can I use animated banners?", "answer": "GIFs are technically accepted but won't animate on YouTube. Use static images for best results. Save animation for intros and videos."},
    {"question": "How often should I update my banner?", "answer": "Update for major milestones (subscriber counts), seasonal events, or when branding changes. Monthly updates are excessive, annual is minimum."}
