  "faq": [
    {"question": "Should I read scripts word-for-word?", "answer": "Depends on style. Some creators read verbatim (teleprompter). Others use outlines and speak naturally. Hybrid common—scripted hooks, outlined body. Find what works for your delivery style."},
    {"question": "How to sound natural when scripted?", "answer": "Write conversationally—use contractions, casual language. Read aloud while writing. Practice until it feels natural. Record multiple takes. Edit out stilted delivery. It takes practice."},
    {"question": "What are open loops?", "answer": "Teasing upcoming content to keep viewers watching. 'In a minute I'll show you...' or 'but first...' Creates curiosity that must be satisfied by watching. Powerful retention technique."},
    {"question": "How long should scripts be?", "answer": "Rough guide: 150 words = 1 minute of speaking. But varies by pace. Write based on content needed, not target length. Better to be concise than pad for length."}
