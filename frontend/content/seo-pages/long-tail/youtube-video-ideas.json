    {"question": "How do I find ideas for my specific niche?", "answer": "Search your niche keywords on YouTube, check 'People also search for', browse niche subreddits, and analyze what competitors' videos get the most views."},
    {"question": "Should I copy what's working for others?", "answer": "Study successful formats but add your unique perspective. Same topic, different angle. Pure copying provides no value and doesn't build your brand."},
    {"question": "How many video ideas should I have queued?", "answer": "Aim for 20-30 ideas in your backlog. This prevents content panic and lets you choose the best idea for your current energy and resources."},
    {"question": "What if my ideas have already been done?", "answer": "Every idea has been done. Your unique take, personality, and presentation is what matters. There's room for multiple perspectives on any topic."}
