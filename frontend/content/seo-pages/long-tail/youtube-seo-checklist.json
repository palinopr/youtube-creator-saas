    {"question": "Do I need to do all of this for every video?", "answer": "The core elements (title, description, tags, thumbnail) are essential for every video. Additional steps like cards and end screens can be added in batches later if needed."},
    {"question": "How long should I spend on SEO per video?", "answer": "Most optimization should take 15-30 minutes per video once you have a system. Keyword research might add 15 minutes for new topics. It's time well spent."},
    {"question": "What's the most important SEO element?", "answer": "Title and thumbnail together drive CTR, which is crucial for discovery. After that, watch time (content quality) matters most. Tags and description are supporting factors."},
    {"question": "Should I update old videos with better SEO?", "answer": "Yes, especially for videos that get search traffic. Updating titles, descriptions, and thumbnails can revive underperforming content. Prioritize videos with potential."}
