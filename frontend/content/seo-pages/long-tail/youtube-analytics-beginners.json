    {"question": "Which metric matters most?", "answer": "Watch time is YouTube's priority for recommendations. But CTR gets people to click first. Focus on both together."},
    {"question": "How often should I check analytics?", "answer": "Weekly for trends, daily check for new uploads (first 48 hours matter). Don't obsess hourly—data needs time."},
    {"question": "Why are my views low?", "answer": "Check CTR (thumbnail/title issue if low) and retention (content issue if low). Both need to be good for YouTube to recommend."},
    {"question": "What's Real-Time analytics?", "answer": "Shows views in last 48 hours and 60 minutes. Useful for seeing new upload performance. Under 'Overview' tab."}
