  "faq": [
    {"question": "What's the most important KPI?", "answer": "Average view duration. It directly signals to YouTube that content is worth recommending. High AVD videos get pushed more. Focus here."},
    {"question": "How often should I check analytics?", "answer": "Weekly for trends. Daily checking creates anxiety over normal fluctuations. Focus on patterns over time, not individual data points."},
    {"question": "What's a good CTR?", "answer": "4-10% is typical. Above 10% is excellent. Below 2% needs work. Compare to your own videos—external benchmarks vary by niche."},
    {"question": "Should I track everything?", "answer": "No—focus on 3-5 key metrics. Too many metrics leads to paralysis. Master the important ones first, add complexity later."}
