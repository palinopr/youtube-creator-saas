  "faq": [
    {"question": "What's a good retention rate?", "answer": "40%+ is solid for most content. 50%+ is excellent. Short videos naturally have higher retention percentages. Compare against your own averages."},
    {"question": "Why does my retention drop at the start?", "answer": "First 30 seconds critical. Viewers deciding if video is worth their time. Hook hard, deliver value fast. Cut generic intros."},
    {"question": "How do I find retention data?", "answer": "YouTube Studio > Analytics > Engagement. Look at audience retention graph. Shows exactly where viewers leave."},
    {"question": "Does video length affect retention?", "answer": "Yes and no. Longer videos have lower percentage but can have more total watch time. Match length to content—don't pad or cut short."}
