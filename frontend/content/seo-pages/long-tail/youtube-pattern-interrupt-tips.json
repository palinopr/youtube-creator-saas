Pattern interrupts are intentional changes that reset attention and keep viewers engaged. Strategic interrupts throughout your video dramatically improve retention."},

  "faq": [
    {"question": "How often should I use pattern interrupts?", "answer": "Every 30-60 seconds is common guideline. More frequent for energetic content. Less for calm, educational content. Watch retention graphs—add interrupts where people drop off."},
    {"question": "What's the easiest pattern interrupt?", "answer": "Zoom cuts—just punch in on your footage in post. No extra filming needed. Easy to add, effective for emphasis. Combine with slight camera shake for energy."},
    {"question": "Can you overdo pattern interrupts?", "answer": "Yes—constant interrupts become exhausting and feel chaotic. Balance engagement with breathing room. Match your niche expectations. Educational content needs fewer than entertainment."},
    {"question": "Do pattern interrupts help SEO?", "answer": "Indirectly—they improve retention, and retention signals quality to algorithm. Higher average view duration = more recommendations. Pattern interrupts serve algorithm by serving viewers."}
