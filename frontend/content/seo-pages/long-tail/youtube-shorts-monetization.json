    {"question": "How much do YouTube Shorts pay?", "answer": "RPM typically ranges from $0.02-0.10 per 1000 views. Much lower than long-form. 1 million views might earn $20-100, varying by factors."},
    {"question": "Is the Shorts Fund still active?", "answer": "The original Shorts Fund was replaced by revenue sharing in February 2023. Shorts now earn from the ad revenue pool system."},
    {"question": "Does using trending sounds hurt revenue?", "answer": "Yes. Licensed music splits your share with rights holders. For maximum revenue, use original audio or royalty-free music."},
    {"question": "Are Shorts worth it for money?", "answer": "For direct revenue, usually no. For building audience that watches long-form content, absolutely. Think of Shorts as discovery, not income."}
