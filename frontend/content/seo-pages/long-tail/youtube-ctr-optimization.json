  "faq": [
    {"question": "What's a good CTR on YouTube?", "answer": "4-10% is typical. Varies by content type and traffic source. Home page CTR is usually lower than search. Compare to your own average."},
    {"question": "Does CTR affect algorithm?", "answer": "Yes. Higher CTR means more of your impressions convert. YouTube gives more impressions to videos that people click on."},
    {"question": "Should I change thumbnails on old videos?", "answer": "Yes, if CTR is low. New thumbnails can revive underperforming videos. YouTube re-evaluates videos with new thumbnails."},
    {"question": "How do I A/B test thumbnails?", "answer": "YouTube has native A/B testing in Studio (for eligible creators). Or manually swap thumbnails and compare CTR over time."}
