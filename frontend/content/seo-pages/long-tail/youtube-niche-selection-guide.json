  "faq": [
    {"question": "Can I change my niche later?", "answer": "Yes, but costly. Audience built for one topic may not follow. Better to pivot related than completely change. Choose carefully upfront."},
    {"question": "Should I choose profitable or passion?", "answer": "Ideally both. Pure passion without demand means small audience. Pure profit without interest leads to burnout. Find overlap."},
    {"question": "How specific should my niche be?", "answer": "Specific enough to be memorable and own a space. General enough to produce ongoing content. 'Guitar tutorials for beginners' better than just 'music.'"},
    {"question": "What if my niche is saturated?", "answer": "Find unique angle—different format, specific sub-niche, unique personality. Saturated means demand exists. Stand out, don't compete directly."}
