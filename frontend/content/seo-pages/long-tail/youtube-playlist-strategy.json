  "faq": [
    {"question": "How many playlists should I have?", "answer": "Depends on content volume. Start with 3-5 main categories. Don't over-segment small catalogs. Add playlists as content grows. Quality organization matters more than quantity."},
    {"question": "Should I put videos in multiple playlists?", "answer": "Yes—one video can be in multiple playlists where relevant. Course playlist AND topic playlist. Increases discovery paths. Don't force-fit though."},
    {"question": "Do playlists help SEO?", "answer": "Yes—playlists appear in search results. Well-titled playlists can rank. Playlist pages are indexable. Treat playlist titles like video titles for SEO."},
    {"question": "What order for videos in playlist?", "answer": "For courses: chronological/logical progression. For topics: best performer first to hook viewers. Experiment with order. First video matters most—it's the entry point."}
