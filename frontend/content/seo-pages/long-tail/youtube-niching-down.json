  "faq": [
    {"question": "How specific should I niche?", "answer": "Specific enough to own, broad enough to sustain. 'Photography' is too broad. 'Macro photography of insects with vintage lenses' might be too narrow. 'Budget photography gear reviews' is often right level."},
    {"question": "Can I change niches later?", "answer": "Yes, but it's hard. Audience came for specific content. Gradual evolution works better than sudden pivots. Some creators start new channels for new niches. Consider before committing."},
    {"question": "What if I have multiple interests?", "answer": "Pick one to start. Establish before expanding. Multiple interests can become content pillars within a niche. Or find overlap between interests. Scattered content confuses audience and algorithm."},
    {"question": "How to know if niche is viable?", "answer": "Search YouTube—does content exist and perform? But not too saturated. Can you add unique value? Would you watch 100 videos on this? Community exists and is active? Trust your research."}
