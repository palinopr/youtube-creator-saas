  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long to reach 1,000 subscribers?", "answer": "Varies wildly—weeks to years depending on niche, quality, and promotion. Average is 1-2 years for consistent creators. Some hit it in months. Focus on improvement, not timeline comparison."},
    {"question": "How to get the Play Button?", "answer": "Automatic for 100K (Silver), 1M (Gold), 10M (Diamond). YouTube sends notification to claim. Takes 2-3 months to arrive. Must meet guidelines—no strikes. Custom awards for 50M and 100M."},
    {"question": "Do subscriber counts always go up?", "answer": "No—subscribers come and go. YouTube also removes spam/inactive accounts periodically. Dips are normal. Focus on net growth over time. Active subscribers matter more than total count."},
    {"question": "What matters more: subs or views?", "answer": "Views and watch time matter more for revenue and algorithm. Subscribers are vanity metric—many don't watch every video. Engaged small audience beats large inactive one. Build community, not just numbers."}
