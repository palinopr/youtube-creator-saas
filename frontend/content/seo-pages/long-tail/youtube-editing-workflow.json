  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long should editing take?", "answer": "Varies wildly—hour of footage might take 2-10 hours to edit depending on complexity. Track your time to improve. 3-4 hours per 10-minute video is common for polished content."},
    {"question": "Best editing software for YouTube?", "answer": "Premiere Pro industry standard. DaVinci Resolve free and powerful. Final Cut Pro for Mac users. CapCut for simple edits. Use what you know or are willing to learn deeply."},
    {"question": "Should I edit myself or hire?", "answer": "Start yourself to understand the craft. Outsource when editing time prevents creating more content. Hiring frees time but costs money. Many successful creators still self-edit."},
    {"question": "How to edit faster?", "answer": "Master keyboard shortcuts—biggest impact. Create templates and presets. Organize footage before editing. Edit in passes (structure, then pacing, then polish). Don't over-edit—done beats perfect."}
