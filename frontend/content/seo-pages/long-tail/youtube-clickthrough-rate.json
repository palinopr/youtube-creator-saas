    {"question": "What's a good CTR?", "answer": "Varies by niche and audience size. 4-10% is solid for most creators. Small channels often have higher CTR (loyal audience), dropping as you grow."},
    {"question": "Does CTR affect algorithm?", "answer": "Yes, CTR is a ranking signal. But it's balanced with retention. High CTR + low retention = clickbait signals. Need both."},
    {"question": "How to check CTR?", "answer": "YouTube Studio > Analytics > Reach tab. See CTR by video, by traffic source. Filter by date range for trends."},
    {"question": "Should I change old thumbnails?", "answer": "Yes, if CTR is low. Updating thumbnails can revive old videos. Test with your lowest-CTR content first."}
