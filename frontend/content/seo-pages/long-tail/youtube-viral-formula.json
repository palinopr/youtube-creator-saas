    {"question": "Can you guarantee a viral video?", "answer": "No—virality has luck component. But you can stack the odds. Understand patterns, optimize elements, create more attempts. Volume + optimization = eventual viral hit."},
    {"question": "Should I try to go viral?", "answer": "Not as primary strategy. Build sustainable content first. Viral is bonus. Channels built on viral hits struggle when they stop. Consistent content > chasing viral."},
    {"question": "How important is timing?", "answer": "Significant for trend-based content. Posting about news event days late kills viral potential. For evergreen content, timing matters less."},
    {"question": "Do viral videos help channel long-term?", "answer": "Mixed—can bring subscribers but often wrong audience. Viral viewers may not watch your regular content. Treat viral as awareness, not growth strategy."}
