  "faq": [
    {"question": "What's the most important optimization?", "answer": "Thumbnail and title together—they determine click-through rate. CTR is the first gate. Without clicks, content quality doesn't matter. Spend disproportionate time on these."},
    {"question": "Can I optimize old videos?", "answer": "Yes and you should. Update thumbnails, titles, descriptions of underperforming videos. Add cards to older videos linking to newer content. Optimization never stops."},
    {"question": "How many tags should I use?", "answer": "Use all relevant tags up to the 500 character limit. Mix broad and specific terms. Tags have less weight than before but still help YouTube understand content. Don't spam irrelevant tags."},
    {"question": "When to A/B test thumbnails?", "answer": "Test when video underperforms expectations. YouTube's test feature available to larger channels. Manually test by changing and monitoring CTR. Give each version adequate time to gather data."}
