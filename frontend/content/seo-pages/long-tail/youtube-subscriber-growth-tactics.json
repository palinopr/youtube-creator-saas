  "faq": [
    {"question": "When should I ask for subscribers?", "answer": "After delivering value, not at the start. Viewers need reason to subscribe. Best moments: after a valuable tip, before revealing something good, at natural pause points. Don't beg—earn it."},
    {"question": "Why do people subscribe?", "answer": "They want more of what you offer. Consistent value, personality they connect with, content they don't want to miss. Subscription is a bet that future content will be worth watching."},
    {"question": "Do Shorts help with subscribers?", "answer": "Shorts drive discovery but lower subscription rates than long-form. Viewers browse Shorts differently. Use Shorts to introduce channel, long-form to convert. Some Shorts creators see subscriber growth; results vary."},
    {"question": "How important are subscriber counts?", "answer": "Less than you think—watch time and engagement matter more for algorithm. But subscribers do watch more consistently and get notifications. Focus on value; subscribers follow quality content."}
