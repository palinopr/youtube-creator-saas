  "faq": [
    {"question": "How many pillars should I have?", "answer": "3-5 is the sweet spot. Fewer than 3 may feel limiting. More than 5 becomes scattered and confusing for audience. Start with 3, add as you grow and understand your content better."},
    {"question": "Can pillars change over time?", "answer": "Yes—channels evolve. What works early may shift. Pay attention to what resonates with audience. Add pillars that gain traction, retire ones that don't. Annual review recommended."},
    {"question": "What if my content doesn't fit pillars?", "answer": "Occasional off-pillar content is fine—but too much confuses audience. If you're consistently drawn outside your pillars, maybe they're wrong. Adjust pillars to match your actual interests and strengths."},
    {"question": "How do pillars relate to playlists?", "answer": "Often 1:1—each pillar becomes a playlist. Makes organization natural. Helps viewers find more content they like. Also aids content planning—check which playlist needs new content."}
