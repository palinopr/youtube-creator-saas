    {"question": "What should I buy first?", "answer": "Microphone. Bad audio makes viewers leave immediately. Upgrade audio before camera every time."},
    {"question": "When should I upgrade from phone?", "answer": "After 50-100 videos, when you know your style and specific needs. Many successful creators never upgrade."},
    {"question": "Is webcam or phone better?", "answer": "Modern phones are usually better than most webcams. Only high-end webcams (Elgato Facecam) beat good phones."}
