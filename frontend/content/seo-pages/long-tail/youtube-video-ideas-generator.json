  "faq": [
    {"question": "How many ideas should I have backlogged?", "answer": "Aim for 50+ ideas minimum in your master list. Never worry about running out. Most ideas won't become videos—that's fine. The goal is abundance. Add faster than you produce."},
    {"question": "What if my niche feels too narrow?", "answer": "Narrow niches have depth—go more specific, not broader. 100 videos on one topic is possible. Different formats, levels, updates. Narrow + deep beats broad + shallow for audience building."},
    {"question": "Should I make videos on trending topics?", "answer": "If relevant to your niche, yes. Your angle on trending topic can work. Don't chase irrelevant trends. Trend + your expertise = good. Pure trend chasing without relevance = audience confusion."},
    {"question": "How to pick which idea to make next?", "answer": "Balance: what you're excited about, what audience wants, what's timely. Enthusiasm shows in content. Data shows what works. Seasonal/trending topics have windows. Mix of all three."}
