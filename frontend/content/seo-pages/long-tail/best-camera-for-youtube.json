    {"question": "Should I just use my phone?", "answer": "For starting out, absolutely. Modern phones have excellent video. Invest in lighting and audio first. Upgrade camera when you hit phone limitations."},
    {"question": "What's the best budget YouTube camera?", "answer": "Sony ZV-E10 is hard to beat around $700. Great autofocus, flip screen, mic input, and interchangeable lenses for growth. The ZV-1 is solid for compact needs."},
    {"question": "Do I need 4K for YouTube?", "answer": "Not required, but recommended. 4K gives you crop/zoom flexibility in editing and future-proofs your content. 1080p is still acceptable."},
    {"question": "Mirrorless vs camcorder?", "answer": "Mirrorless offers better image quality and flexibility. Camcorders offer reliability and longer record times. For most YouTube content, mirrorless wins."}
