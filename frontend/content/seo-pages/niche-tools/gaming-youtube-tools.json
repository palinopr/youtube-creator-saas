  "faq": [
    {"question": "What recording software has the least FPS impact?", "answer": "NVIDIA ShadowPlay (for NVIDIA GPUs) has minimal impact since it uses dedicated hardware encoding. OBS with NVENC encoding is a close second with more flexibility."},
    {"question": "Do I need a capture card?", "answer": "Only if you're recording console gameplay to a PC. Modern consoles have built-in recording, and PC gaming can be captured directly with software."},
    {"question": "How do gaming channels find trending games?", "answer": "Tools like TubeGrow, Social Blade, and SteamDB help identify rising games before they peak. Watching the gaming community on Twitter and Reddit also provides early signals."},
    {"question": "Is facecam necessary for gaming content?", "answer": "Not required, but it can increase engagement. Many successful gaming channels use only gameplay with commentary. Test both approaches and see what your audience prefers."}
