  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best time to film garden?", "answer": "Early morning (golden hour) or overcast days. Avoid harsh midday sun—creates tough shadows and blown highlights."},
    {"question": "How to deal with wind noise?", "answer": "Dead cat/windscreen on microphone essential. Also record voiceover inside as backup. Wind is gardening content's biggest challenge."},
    {"question": "Time-lapse tips?", "answer": "Use intervalometer, consistent lighting if possible, secure camera position. Days to weeks depending on plant. Be patient."},
    {"question": "Should I show face or just garden?", "answer": "Both work. Face builds connection. Garden-only is cinematic. Many successful channels mix approaches."}
