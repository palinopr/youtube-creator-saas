    {"question": "How to film smoke?", "answer": "Backlight makes smoke visible—position light source behind the smoker. Early morning or late afternoon natural light works well. Avoid direct midday sun that washes out smoke. Dark background shows smoke better."},
    {"question": "Best camera for outdoor cooking?", "answer": "Weather-sealed cameras help. Sony A7 series, Panasonic GH6 popular. GoPro for time-lapse and action shots. Keep main camera away from direct smoke and heat. UV filter protects lens from grease splatter."},
    {"question": "How to cover long cooks?", "answer": "Time-lapse is essential for 8-16 hour cooks. Check-in segments show progress. Fast-forward with voiceover explanation. The reveal shot should be carefully planned and well-lit. Don't skip the waiting."},
    {"question": "Dealing with wind noise?", "answer": "Deadcat windscreens mandatory outdoors. Lavalier with foam windscreen inside clothing. Record voiceover inside if wind is bad. Natural outdoor sound can add authenticity if not too windy."}
