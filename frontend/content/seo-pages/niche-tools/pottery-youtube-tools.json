  "faq": [
    {"question": "How to protect cameras from clay?", "answer": "Distance is your friend—use longer focal lengths. Acrylic splash guards help. Rain covers/sleeves for protection. Keep lens cloths handy. Accept some risk—pottery is messy."},
    {"question": "Best angle for wheel throwing?", "answer": "Front angle is classic—shows form emerging. Overhead creates hypnotic content. Side shows height and pulling. Most successful pottery channels use all three, switching during edits."},
    {"question": "Audio for pottery videos?", "answer": "Two approaches: embrace sounds (ASMR appeal) or voiceover everything (cleaner education). Wheel motor and water splashing are ambient. Many viewers find pottery sounds soothing."},
    {"question": "Lighting a pottery studio?", "answer": "Consistent artificial light preferred—natural light changes. Soft, diffused light flatters wet clay. Avoid harsh shadows in the bowl interior. Multiple sources reduce contrast issues."}
