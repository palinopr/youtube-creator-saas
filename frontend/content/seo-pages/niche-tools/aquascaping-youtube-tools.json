  "faq": [
    {"question": "How to avoid glass reflections?", "answer": "Dark room, matte black cloth around camera, lens hood pressed close to glass. Polarizing filter helps some situations. Film at slight angle if straight-on reflects. Test before full shoot."},
    {"question": "Best time to film aquarium?", "answer": "When fish are active and plants pearling (producing oxygen bubbles). Avoid right after feeding—cloudy water. Morning light plus tank light can work. Consistent tank lighting preferred."},
    {"question": "Camera for aquarium filming?", "answer": "Sony A6400 or similar with manual controls popular. Macro lens for detail shots. 4K for cropping flexibility. Manual white balance essential—auto WB fights tank lights constantly."},
    {"question": "How to capture accurate colors?", "answer": "Custom white balance with white card in tank. Post-processing adjustment often needed. Different LED spectrums (planted vs reef) require different settings. Test and adjust per tank."}
