  "faq": [
    {"question": "What is COPPA?", "answer": "Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. US law protecting kids under 13. YouTube enforces globally. Non-compliance = serious fines."},
    {"question": "Can kids content be monetized?", "answer": "Yes, but with limitations. No personalized ads means lower CPM. Still monetizable with contextual ads. Some categories do well."},
    {"question": "Should I mark all videos Made for Kids?", "answer": "Only if content targets kids. Incorrectly marking affects recommendations. YouTube may override your designation if content appears for kids."},
    {"question": "What features are disabled for kids content?", "answer": "Comments, notifications, stories, end screens (limited), mini-player, offline save in main app. Significant limitations."}
