    {"question": "Do I need to show my face in educational videos?", "answer": "Not always. Many successful educational channels are screen-only or animation-only. However, face cam can build connection and trust. Consider hybrid approaches with occasional face cam segments."},
    {"question": "How long should educational videos be?", "answer": "Long enough to cover the topic thoroughly, short enough to maintain attention. 8-15 minutes works well for most tutorials. For deep dives, create a playlist instead of one super-long video."},
    {"question": "What's the best screen recording software?", "answer": "For beginners, Loom is simple and free. For more control, OBS is free and powerful. Camtasia offers the best editing integration but costs money. Choose based on your editing workflow."},
    {"question": "How do I make tutorials engaging?", "answer": "Use visual variety: zoom in on important areas, add callouts and highlights, include practical examples, and break content into clear chapters. The pacing of information matters as much as the content itself."}
