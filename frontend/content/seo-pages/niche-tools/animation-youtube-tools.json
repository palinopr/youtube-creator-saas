  "faq": [
    {"question": "What's the best free animation software?", "answer": "Blender for 3D animation is incredibly powerful and free. OpenToonz is excellent for 2D. Krita has animation features. DaVinci Resolve's Fusion is free for motion graphics."},
    {"question": "Do I need a drawing tablet?", "answer": "For hand-drawn animation, absolutely. Wacom is industry standard, but XP-Pen and Huion offer great value. Even basic tablets work for starting out."},
    {"question": "How long does animation take?", "answer": "Varies massively. Simple motion graphics: hours. Whiteboard animation: days. Full frame-by-frame: weeks or months per minute. Plan accordingly."},
    {"question": "Can I animate on an iPad?", "answer": "Yes. Procreate Dreams, Rough Animator, and FlipaClip work well on iPad. For professional work, desktop software offers more power."}
