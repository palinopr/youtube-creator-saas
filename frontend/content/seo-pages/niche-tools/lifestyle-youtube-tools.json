    {"question": "How do lifestyle YouTubers afford their lifestyle?", "answer": "Many are strategic about what they show. Sponsorships, affiliate income, and smart budgeting help. Not everything on screen is as expensive as it looks."},
    {"question": "What's the best aesthetic editing style?", "answer": "Depends on your brand. Warm and cozy, clean and minimal, or vibrant and saturated all work. Pick one style and stay consistent."},
    {"question": "Do I need to show my face?", "answer": "Not required. 'Day in my life' and lifestyle B-roll channels exist. But face-to-camera builds stronger audience connection for most lifestyle content."},
    {"question": "How often should lifestyle channels post?", "answer": "Weekly is standard for long-form. Daily Shorts work well. Consistency matters more than frequency. Don't burn out trying to post daily vlogs."}
