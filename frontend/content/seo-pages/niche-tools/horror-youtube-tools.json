    {"question": "How do I make content genuinely scary?", "answer": "Tension over jump scares. Sound design is crucial. Let imagination do work. What you don't show is scarier than what you do."},
    {"question": "What lighting creates the creepiest effect?", "answer": "Low-key, hard shadows. Single source from below or side. Colored light (especially blue/green) adds unease. Embrace darkness."},
    {"question": "Best microphone for horror narration?", "answer": "Warm condenser microphones work well. SM7B or Rode NT1. Record close for intimate, creepy delivery. Quality matters for voice content."},
    {"question": "How do I find horror sound effects?", "answer": "Epidemic Sound, Artlist have horror packs. Freesound.org for free options. Recording your own is best for unique sounds."}
