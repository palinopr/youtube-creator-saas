  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best camera angle for tutorials?", "answer": "Overhead looking down at work is standard for stitch tutorials. Add front-facing for personality. Two angles ideal—overhead for hands, face for talking."},
    {"question": "How to show stitch detail clearly?", "answer": "Good lighting is key—eliminate shadows. Macro lens for extreme close-up. Light colored yarn shows better on camera. Slow your pace for clarity."},
    {"question": "Should I talk while knitting?", "answer": "Popular styles include: narrated tutorials, podcast-style chatting while working, or voiceover added later. Find what feels natural for you."},
    {"question": "Best lighting for yarn colors?", "answer": "Daylight-balanced LED panels. Avoid warm light that shifts colors. Film in consistent lighting. Show yarn in natural light briefly for accuracy."}
