  "faq": [
    {"question": "How do I film while using both hands?", "answer": "Lock-off shots on tripods with cameras rolling continuously. Edit out the camera-free portions. Wireless mics let you narrate while working."},
    {"question": "What about camera damage in dusty workshops?", "answer": "Use weather-sealed cameras if possible. Protect with lens hoods and covers between shots. Action cams are durable backup options."},
    {"question": "How do I show small details clearly?", "answer": "Macro lenses or cameras with good close-up capability. High resolution (4K) lets you crop in editing. Good lighting is essential for detail visibility."},
    {"question": "Should I film the whole project or edit heavily?", "answer": "Time-lapse repetitive work, show key steps in real-time. Viewers want to learn, not watch every screw turn. Balance instruction with engagement."}
