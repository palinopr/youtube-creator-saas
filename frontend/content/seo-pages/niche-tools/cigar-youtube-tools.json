  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best camera for cigar reviews?", "answer": "Sony A7 series excellent low light. Canon M50 good budget option. Macro lens or mode for wrapper details. Compact size helpful for lounge filming. Good audio input essential."},
    {"question": "Filming in cigar lounges?", "answer": "Always ask permission first—many welcome exposure. Be respectful of other patrons. Portable lighting helps dim environments. Lavalier mic essential for clear audio over background."},
    {"question": "How long should reviews be?", "answer": "Depends on format—full smoke 1-2 hours, edited highlight 10-20 minutes. Some viewers enjoy full-length relaxation content. Others prefer condensed reviews. Consider offering both formats."},
    {"question": "Age restrictions and monetization?", "answer": "YouTube restricts tobacco content promotion. Reviews may face limited ads. Some creators focus on community over monetization. Comply with platform policies. Consider alternative revenue streams."}
