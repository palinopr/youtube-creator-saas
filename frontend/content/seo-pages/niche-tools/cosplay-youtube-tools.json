  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best camera for cosplay builds?", "answer": "Overhead setup for workspace most important. Phone works for progress. Sony ZV-E10 or similar for talking head tutorials. Final glamour shots benefit from mirrorless with portrait lens."},
    {"question": "How to film transformation videos?", "answer": "Fixed camera for consistency. Before footage in same position as after. Time-lapse of makeup/costume process. Reveal moment is the payoff—make it dramatic."},
    {"question": "Convention filming tips?", "answer": "Portable setup essential. Gimbal for smooth hall walks. Wireless mic for interviews in crowds. Extra batteries—no charging opportunities. SD cards cleared and ready."},
    {"question": "Lighting for costume photography?", "answer": "Studio setup gives most control—2-3 light setup. Outdoor with flash/reflector for natural light. Match lighting to character mood. Colored gels for dramatic effect."}
