    {"question": "Why is finance CPM so high?", "answer": "Financial advertisers pay premium rates to reach audiences interested in money. Credit cards, brokerages, and fintech have high customer lifetime values. Finance CPM can reach $15-50+."},
    {"question": "Do I need to be certified to make finance content?", "answer": "Not required, but disclaimers are essential. Make clear you're not a financial advisor. Many successful finance creators share knowledge without formal credentials."},
    {"question": "How do I show trading charts legally?", "answer": "Most charting platforms allow educational use. TradingView is commonly used. Read terms of service. Adding commentary transforms content for fair use."},
    {"question": "Should I show my actual investments?", "answer": "Personal choice. Transparency builds trust but exposes privacy. Many show positions, others discuss hypothetically. Consider your comfort level."}
