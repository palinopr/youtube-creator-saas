  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best camera for jewelry?", "answer": "Any camera with macro capability works. True macro lens (1:1 ratio) ideal. Sony, Canon mirrorless popular. Even phone with macro lens can capture good detail. Lighting matters as much as camera."},
    {"question": "How to avoid reflections on metal?", "answer": "Light tent diffuses light beautifully. Position lights at angles, not direct. Matte spray for extreme cases (wash off). Polarizing filter reduces some reflections. Experiment with positions."},
    {"question": "Filming jewelry making process?", "answer": "Overhead camera essential for work surface. Macro for detail shots. Time-lapse long processes. Real-time for key techniques. Mix of angles in edit. Good lighting throughout."},
    {"question": "How to show accurate gem colors?", "answer": "Daylight-balanced lighting (5500K) most accurate. Avoid warm tungsten. Natural light near window works well. Color calibration helps. Show gems in different lights for sparkle."}
