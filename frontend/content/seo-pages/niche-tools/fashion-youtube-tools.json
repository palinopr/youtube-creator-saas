    {"question": "Best camera for fashion YouTube?", "answer": "Any modern mirrorless or good smartphone. Color accuracy matters more than resolution. Sony, Canon, iPhone all work well."},
    {"question": "How to show true colors?", "answer": "High CRI lighting (95+), accurate white balance, minimal color grading. Natural daylight is most accurate."},
    {"question": "Should I show my face?", "answer": "Most fashion creators do—face builds connection and you're modeling the clothes. But hands-and-outfit only channels exist."},
    {"question": "How to film outfit details?", "answer": "Close-up B-roll shots. Macro lens optional but helpful. Show texture, tags, construction details separately."}
