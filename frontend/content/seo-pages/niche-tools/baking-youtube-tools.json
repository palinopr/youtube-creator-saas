  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best overhead camera setup?", "answer": "C-stand with boom arm for heavy cameras. Elgato articulating arm for lighter setups. Wall-mounted rig if permanent studio. Key is stability—shaky overhead ruins shots."},
    {"question": "How to light baking videos?", "answer": "Natural window light is ideal—soft, flattering for food. Large LED panels with diffusion as backup. Side light creates texture. Avoid overhead lighting that creates harsh shadows."},
    {"question": "Filming while baking alone?", "answer": "Prep everything before. Multiple fixed cameras better than moving one. Remote triggers or continuous recording. Accept some imperfection—authenticity matters. Edit out mistakes."},
    {"question": "Best camera for food content?", "answer": "Any camera with good color science. iPhones excellent for food colors. Sony/Canon mirrorless for professional. More important: good lighting and composition than expensive camera."}
