  "faq": [
    {"question": "How do I protect gear on job sites?", "answer": "Use camera covers during dusty work. Clean lenses frequently. Store gear in sealed bags between shots. Compressed air for cleaning."},
    {"question": "Best camera for renovation content?", "answer": "Canon M50, Sony ZV-E10, or similar. Need flip screen to monitor while working. Dust resistance helpful but not critical."},
    {"question": "Should I show my face or just the work?", "answer": "Both. Face builds connection and trust. Work shots teach the technique. Alternate between personality and process."},
    {"question": "How to film while working?", "answer": "Set up camera, do work, then pick up camera for details. Or have someone film you. Solo creators often do sections separately."}
