  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best overhead setup for calligraphy?", "answer": "Copy stand most stable for flat work. C-stand with boom arm for larger setups. Elgato arm for desk-mounted solutions. Key is zero movement while writing. Position camera directly overhead."},
    {"question": "How to avoid hand shadows?", "answer": "Dual light sources from opposite sides. Diffused lights reduce harsh shadows. LED panels at 45-degree angles work well. Test with your actual writing position before filming."},
    {"question": "Should I include pen sounds?", "answer": "Yes—calligraphy sounds are ASMR gold. Nib scratching on paper, ink flow, satisfying strokes. Quiet room and close microphone placement. Many viewers watch specifically for the sounds."},
    {"question": "Real-time or sped up?", "answer": "Both have audiences. Real-time is meditative and educational. Time-lapse shows longer pieces efficiently. Many creators do both—real-time process, time-lapse for complex pieces."}
