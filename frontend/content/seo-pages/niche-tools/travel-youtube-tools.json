  "faq": [
    {"question": "GoPro or mirrorless for travel?", "answer": "Both, ideally. GoPro for action, water, and POV. Mirrorless for cinematic B-roll and talking head. If choosing one, pick based on your primary content style."},
    {"question": "How do travel vloggers backup footage?", "answer": "Portable SSDs (Samsung T7), cloud upload when WiFi allows, and sometimes shipping drives home. Losing footage is the biggest travel creator fear."},
    {"question": "Can I edit travel videos on mobile?", "answer": "Yes. LumaFusion on iPad is surprisingly powerful. CapCut works well for simpler edits. Many travel creators edit entirely on mobile."},
    {"question": "What about drones for travel?", "answer": "DJI Mini series is travel-friendly (under 250g, fewer regulations). But research drone laws for each destination - many countries restrict or ban drones."}
