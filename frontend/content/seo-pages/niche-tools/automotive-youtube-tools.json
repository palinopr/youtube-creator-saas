    {"question": "How do I mount cameras on a car?", "answer": "Heavy-duty suction mounts from brands like Ram Mount or Delkin Fat Gecko. Always use safety tethers. Check local laws for exterior mounting."},
    {"question": "How do I get good audio while driving?", "answer": "Wireless lavalier mics work best. Close to your mouth beats road noise. Some creators voice-over later for cleaner audio."},
    {"question": "Do I need a drone for car content?", "answer": "Helpful but not required. Aerial shots add production value but many successful car channels don't use them. Start without, add later."},
    {"question": "How do car YouTubers get press cars?", "answer": "Build audience first. Contact manufacturer PR departments. Start with local dealers who may loan cars for exposure. Consistent quality content attracts opportunities."}
