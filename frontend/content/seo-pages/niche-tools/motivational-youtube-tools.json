    {"question": "Do I need to be a speaker to create motivation content?", "answer": "Not necessarily. Some channels curate existing speeches, create visual compilations, or focus on written wisdom. Find your angle."},
    {"question": "What music works best for motivation?", "answer": "Builds from soft to powerful. Orchestra, piano, and electronic work well. Match energy to message arc. Avoid lyrics that distract."},

    {"question": "How do I build authority as a motivator?", "answer": "Share personal experience. Be consistent. Deliver value regularly. Your story and perspective matter. Don't just repeat quotes."}
