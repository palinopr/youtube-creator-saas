    {"question": "Recording audio outdoors?", "answer": "Wind is your enemy—use dead cat windscreens always. Wireless lavs give freedom while demonstrating. Record voiceover in shelter for clean narration. Always monitor in field."},
    {"question": "Filming in rain/snow?", "answer": "Rain covers for cameras. GoPro/action cams handle weather natively. Lens cloths essential. Silica gel packets in bags prevent moisture. Have dry backup gear."}
