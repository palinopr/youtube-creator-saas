  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best onboard camera for RC?", "answer": "GoPro Hero for durability and quality. Insta360 Go for ultra-light on small RCs. RunCam for FPV setups. Weight matters—lighter is better for performance. Secure mounting essential for crashes."},
    {"question": "How to film fast RC cars?", "answer": "Tripod with fluid head for panning. Position at track curves for dramatic shots. High frame rate for slow-mo. Practice tracking before filming runs. Multiple angles make better final edit."},
    {"question": "Where to fly/drive for content?", "answer": "RC clubs and tracks offer community and facilities. Open fields for planes (check regulations). Skate parks sometimes allow RC. Private property with permission. Avoid public spaces with restrictions."},
    {"question": "Do crash videos perform well?", "answer": "Yes—crashes are often the most viewed content. Include them, don't hide failures. Slow-mo crash replays are satisfying. Balance with successful runs. Viewers appreciate honesty about mishaps."}
