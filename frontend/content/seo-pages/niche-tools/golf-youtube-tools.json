    {"question": "Best camera for golf swing?", "answer": "iPhone Pro does 240fps slo-mo—very effective. Sony A7S III for pro quality 4K at 120fps. Any camera with 120fps+ works for analysis. Tripod or mount essential for consistent angles."},
    {"question": "Can I film on any golf course?", "answer": "Always get permission first. Many courses welcome content for exposure. Some restrict or prohibit filming. Establish relationships with local courses. Private clubs often more restrictive."},
    {"question": "Audio challenges on course?", "answer": "Wind is major issue—deadcat windscreens mandatory. Wireless lavalier under clothing helps. Consider ADR/voiceover for windy days. Natural course sounds add ambiance when controlled."},
    {"question": "Should I use a drone?", "answer": "Drone footage elevates production significantly. Check course rules and local regulations. Many courses near airports restrict drones. Beautiful establishing shots and hole flyovers worth the effort."}
