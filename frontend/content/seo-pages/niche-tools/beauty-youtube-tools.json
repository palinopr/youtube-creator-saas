  "faq": [
    {"question": "What ring light size is best for beauty content?", "answer": "18-inch ring lights are the most popular for beauty. They're large enough to create soft, even light but not so big they're impractical. 12-inch works for tighter spaces."},
    {"question": "How do I ensure color accuracy?", "answer": "Use daylight-balanced lighting (5000-5500K), shoot in a color profile that preserves information, and calibrate your editing monitor. Always test how colors look on different devices."},
    {"question": "Do I need an expensive camera?", "answer": "Not necessarily. Many beauty YouTubers use phones with good cameras. Lighting matters more than camera price. A $300 camera with great lighting beats a $2000 camera with bad lighting."},
    {"question": "How do beauty channels get sponsored?", "answer": "Build an engaged audience and showcase products authentically. Brands look for creators with good engagement rates and content that aligns with their products. Start by reaching out to smaller brands."}
