  "faq": [
    {"question": "How to film yoga alone?", "answer": "Flip screen camera on tripod is essential. Remote trigger or app control helps. Practice sequence first, then film. Wide angle captures full mat area."},
    {"question": "Best lens for yoga videos?", "answer": "Wide angle (10-18mm on crop, 16-35mm on full frame) shows full body in smaller spaces. Ultra-wide can distort, test before committing."},
    {"question": "How to handle background music?", "answer": "Add in post-editing for control. Use royalty-free sources. Some creators record with music playing but this limits editing. Separate is more flexible."},
    {"question": "Should I mirror my instruction?", "answer": "Yes—when you say 'lift your right arm,' viewers' right arm should lift. Practice cueing in mirror. Or use post-flip if camera allows."}
