    {"question": "Best editing software for comedy?", "answer": "Premiere Pro for precise timing control. DaVinci Resolve free version works great too. Key is learning keyboard shortcuts for fast editing."},
    {"question": "How to time sound effects?", "answer": "Place on beat with joke delivery. Too early ruins it, too late misses moment. Practice. Study how successful comedians time theirs."},
    {"question": "Should comedy videos be short?", "answer": "Depends on format. Shorts work for quick jokes. Longer for sketch/commentary. Pacing matters more than length. Cut ruthlessly regardless."},
    {"question": "How to make thumbnails funny?", "answer": "Exaggerated expressions, absurd situations, clear visual joke. The thumbnail should make people curious about the punchline."}
