  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best camera for electronics work?", "answer": "Any camera with good macro capability. Sony A6400 with macro lens popular. USB microscope for extreme detail. Overhead positioning matters more than camera brand."},
    {"question": "How to avoid reflections on components?", "answer": "Diffused lighting from multiple angles. Avoid direct overhead light on shiny surfaces. Matte work surface helps. Adjust angles—test before starting project."},
    {"question": "USB microscope vs macro lens?", "answer": "Both useful. Macro lens: better video quality, moderate magnification. USB microscope: extreme magnification, inspection-level detail. Many creators use both."},
    {"question": "Screen recording for oscilloscopes?", "answer": "If digital scope with USB, capture directly. OBS for screen recording. Some scopes have video out. Photos of screen work for static measurements."}
