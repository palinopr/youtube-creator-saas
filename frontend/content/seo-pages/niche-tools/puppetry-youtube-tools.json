    {"question": "How to hide the puppeteer?", "answer": "Puppet stage with curtain is traditional. Camera angle looking up at puppet works. Green screen can help in post. Black backdrop with dark clothing. Plan shots to naturally conceal."},
    {"question": "Best camera angle for puppets?", "answer": "Eye level with puppet creates connection. Slightly below looking up is classic Muppet style. Monitor essential so you can see what camera sees. Test multiple angles for your setup."},
    {"question": "One person or team?", "answer": "Solo possible but challenging—performance while monitoring camera. Team helps: puppeteer focuses on performance, camera operator handles technical. Start solo, add help as channel grows."},
    {"question": "What puppet content works?", "answer": "Comedy sketches with distinct characters. Kids content for educational/entertainment (huge audience). Behind-the-scenes puppet making. Tutorial content for aspiring puppeteers. Choose audience and commit."}
