    {"question": "How do I get my pet to look at the camera?", "answer": "Use treats, squeaky toys, or sounds above/behind the camera. Some pets respond to their name or specific sounds. Experiment to find what works."},
    {"question": "What's the best camera for pet photography?", "answer": "Sony cameras with animal eye AF are excellent. The A6400 or A6700 track pet eyes automatically. Canon R7/R10 also have animal tracking."},
    {"question": "How do I film active pets?", "answer": "High shutter speed (1/500+), continuous autofocus, and burst mode for photos. For video, use stabilization and wide angles to keep pets in frame."},
    {"question": "Should I use lights with pets?", "answer": "Yes, but continuous LED lights only. No flash—it startles pets and causes red/green eye. Soft, diffused light works best."}
