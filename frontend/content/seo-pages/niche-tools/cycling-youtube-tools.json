    {"question": "Best mount for cycling?", "answer": "Chest mount for immersive POV. Handlebar for stable road view. Many creators use multiple mounts for variety. Experiment to find your style."},
    {"question": "GoPro vs Insta360 for cycling?", "answer": "GoPro: traditional, proven, great stabilization. Insta360: 360° means never miss an angle, reframe later. Both excellent—personal preference."},
    {"question": "How to handle wind noise?", "answer": "Add voiceover in post—live audio usually unusable. Or use windscreen foam covers. Some creators embrace ambient sound, others replace entirely."},
    {"question": "Best content type for cycling channels?", "answer": "Gear reviews, ride vlogs, training content, safety tips, commuting guides. Mix of entertainment and education. Local route guides build loyal audience."}
