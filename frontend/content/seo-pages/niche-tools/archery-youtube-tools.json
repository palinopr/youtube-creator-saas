  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best frame rate for arrow flight?", "answer": "120fps minimum, 240fps ideal for detailed slow-mo. At 240fps you see arrow flex, fletching spin, and precise impact. GoPro and iPhone both capable. Dedicated slow-mo cameras exist but expensive."},
    {"question": "How to film hunting safely?", "answer": "Cameras on tripods well out of arrow path. Never mount cameras where you might accidentally shoot them. Bow mounts with quick release. Solo hunting? Use trail camera setups. Safety always first."},
    {"question": "Indoor vs outdoor archery filming?", "answer": "Indoor: controlled lighting easier, consistent background. Outdoor: natural light beautiful but variable. Indoor range may have restrictions on filming. Outdoor offers more content variety."},
    {"question": "Best bow-mounted camera?", "answer": "GoPro Hero or DJI Action with bow stabilizer mount. Keep camera small and light—affects bow balance. Use the stabilizer rail or riser mount points. Film in wide angle to capture full scene."}
