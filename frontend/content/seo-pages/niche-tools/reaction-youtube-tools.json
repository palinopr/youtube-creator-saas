  "faq": [
    {"question": "Are reaction videos legal?", "answer": "Complicated. Transformative commentary can be fair use. But many reactions face claims. Minimize source footage, add substantial commentary."},
    {"question": "How do I avoid copyright claims?", "answer": "Keep clips short, pause frequently for commentary, add transformative value. Some creators ask permission. Claims are common—accept or dispute carefully."},
    {"question": "What camera angle works best?", "answer": "Slightly above eye level, centered. Your face should fill significant portion of frame. Expressions are the content."},
    {"question": "Should I show the full video I'm reacting to?", "answer": "No. Show minimal necessary clips. Your reaction and commentary should be the focus. This helps with copyright and makes better content."}
