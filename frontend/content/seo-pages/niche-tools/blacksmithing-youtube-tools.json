  "faq": [
    {"question": "How to film glowing metal?", "answer": "Manual exposure crucial—auto will blow out bright metal. Expose for the hot metal, let shadows go dark. Consider dual exposure compositing in post. Some cameras have better dynamic range than others."},
    {"question": "Camera too close to forge?", "answer": "Heat damages electronics—maintain safe distance. Telephoto/zoom lens from farther away. Position cameras to the side, not in front of forge opening. Monitor temperatures if concerned."},
    {"question": "Best content for blacksmithing?", "answer": "Knifemaking extremely popular—process and result. Tool making for practical appeal. Restoration projects tell stories. Technique tutorials help community. Full project videos most engaging."},
    {"question": "Audio in the forge?", "answer": "Hammer strikes and sizzling metal are satisfying sounds. Voiceover often recorded separately for clarity. Mix forge sounds lower than painful. Some videos work well with minimal dialogue, just forge sounds."}
