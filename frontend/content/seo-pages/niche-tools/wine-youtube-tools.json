  "faq": [
    {"question": "How to film wine color?", "answer": "Backlight is key—light source behind the glass shows wine color beautifully. White background or napkin helps. Side angle shows depth. Avoid direct front lighting that flattens."},
    {"question": "Best location for wine content?", "answer": "Varies—home studio for consistency and control. Restaurants/wineries for atmosphere and variety. Vineyards for production content. Multiple locations keep content fresh."},
    {"question": "Handle restaurant filming?", "answer": "Always ask permission first. Portable LED for consistent lighting. Lavalier mic essential in noisy environments. Shoot during quiet hours if possible. Be respectful of other diners."},
    {"question": "How to describe wine on camera?", "answer": "Balance accessible and educational. Avoid pretension. Use relatable descriptors. Show your genuine reaction. Educational without being condescending. Practice tasting notes off-camera first."}
