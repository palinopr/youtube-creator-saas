    {"question": "Can I cover any case?", "answer": "Legally, usually yes for public cases. Ethically, consider ongoing investigations, victim families, and your responsibility. Some cases shouldn't be entertainment."},
    {"question": "How to find case information?", "answer": "Court records (PACER, state systems), news archives, public documents. Be skeptical of secondary sources. Primary documents whenever possible."},
    {"question": "Do I need to show my face?", "answer": "No—many successful true crime channels are narration-only with documents and images. Format depends on your style. Either works."},
    {"question": "How to handle sensitive content?", "answer": "Content warnings when needed. Don't show graphic images. Focus on story, not gore. Monetization may be limited—prioritize responsibility over revenue."}
