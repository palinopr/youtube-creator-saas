  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best screen recording for charts?", "answer": "OBS Studio—free, powerful, handles high resolution. Screen capture of TradingView or exchange charts. 4K if possible so text is readable. Bitrate high enough for chart details."},
    {"question": "Should I stream live?", "answer": "Very effective for crypto—viewers want real-time analysis during volatility. Build community through live chat. Archive to YouTube for those who miss live. Major events drive big live audiences."},
    {"question": "How to avoid legal issues?", "answer": "Always include not financial advice disclaimers. Don't promise returns. Disclose if you hold assets discussed. Be transparent about sponsorships. Follow platform guidelines carefully."},
    {"question": "Facecam or no facecam?", "answer": "Both work—facecam builds personal connection and trust. Screen-only can work for pure analysis. Many top channels use picture-in-picture: charts with small facecam. Test what fits your style."}
