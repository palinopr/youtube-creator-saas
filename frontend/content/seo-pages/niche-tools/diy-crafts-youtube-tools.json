  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best camera angle for crafts?", "answer": "Overhead is primary—shows your hands and materials clearly. Add front angle for personality and reactions. Multi-camera elevates production."},
    {"question": "How to film while crafting?", "answer": "Overhead camera on arm, hands-free lav mic, record continuously. Edit out mistakes. Alternatively, do voiceover in post for cleaner audio."},
    {"question": "Should I talk while crafting?", "answer": "Either works. Talking adds personality but can be challenging while focusing. Voiceover gives more control. Many successful channels do both styles."},
    {"question": "How long should craft tutorials be?", "answer": "Long enough to teach, short enough to maintain interest. 10-20 minutes typical. Time-lapse repetitive sections. Don't pad for watch time."}
