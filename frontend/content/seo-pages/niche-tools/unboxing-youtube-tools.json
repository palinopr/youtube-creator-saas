  "faq": [
    {"question": "Do I need an overhead camera?", "answer": "Strongly recommended. Top-down view is essential for unboxing to show products clearly. Phone mount works to start."},
    {"question": "What background works best?", "answer": "Neutral backgrounds (white, gray, black) keep focus on products. Match to your brand. Avoid busy patterns."},
    {"question": "How do I avoid glare on products?", "answer": "Diffused light sources, positioned at angles. Avoid direct lighting on shiny surfaces. Matte products are easier."},
    {"question": "Should I script unboxing videos?", "answer": "Light scripting helps—know your key points. But keep reactions natural. The authentic surprise is part of the appeal."}
