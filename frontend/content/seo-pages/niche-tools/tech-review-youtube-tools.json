  "faq": [
    {"question": "How do I get products to review?", "answer": "Start by reviewing products you already own. As your channel grows, reach out to brands and PR agencies. Many have programs for creators with 10K+ subscribers."},
    {"question": "What lighting makes products look best?", "answer": "Soft, diffused lighting from multiple angles reduces harsh shadows. A key light and fill light at 45-degree angles is a solid starting point. Avoid direct flash."},
    {"question": "Do I need 4K for tech reviews?", "answer": "4K is increasingly expected for tech content. It allows cropping for close-ups and looks more professional. Most modern cameras and phones support 4K now."},
    {"question": "How do I stay objective in sponsored reviews?", "answer": "Disclose sponsorships clearly. Include honest pros and cons. Your audience trusts you - protecting that trust is worth more than any single sponsorship."}
