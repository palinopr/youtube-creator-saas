    {"question": "Can I film workouts with just a phone?", "answer": "Yes, modern phones work well for fitness content, especially with a wide-angle lens attachment. Good lighting and a stable mount are more important than the camera itself."},
    {"question": "How do I add workout timers to videos?", "answer": "Most video editors support timer overlays. DaVinci Resolve and Premiere Pro have timer effects, or you can use dedicated workout video templates from sites like Envato."},
    {"question": "What music can I use in workout videos?", "answer": "Use royalty-free music from Epidemic Sound, Artlist, or YouTube's Audio Library. Copyright claims can demonetize fitness videos since music is so integral to the content."},
    {"question": "Should I create follow-along or instructional content?", "answer": "Both have value. Follow-along workouts drive watch time and repeat views. Instructional content on form and technique builds trust and authority. Most successful fitness channels do both."}
