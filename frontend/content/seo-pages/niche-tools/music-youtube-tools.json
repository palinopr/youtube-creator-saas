  "faq": [
    {"question": "Can I upload cover songs to YouTube?", "answer": "Yes, but with caveats. YouTube's Content ID may claim your video and share ad revenue with the rights holder. You won't get strikes, but monetization may be affected. Original arrangements fare better."},
    {"question": "What's the minimum equipment I need?", "answer": "At minimum: a USB microphone, your instrument, and free DAW software like GarageBand or Audacity. This is enough to start. Upgrade audio interface and mics as you grow."},
    {"question": "Should I also distribute to Spotify?", "answer": "Yes. Services like DistroKid let you upload to all platforms from one place. YouTube + Spotify reach different audiences. Many successful musicians use both strategically."},
    {"question": "How do music channels get discovered?", "answer": "Cover songs of popular tracks, reaction videos, tutorials, and trending sounds all drive discovery. Original music benefits from consistent style and playlist optimization."}
