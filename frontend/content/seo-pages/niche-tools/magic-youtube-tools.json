  "faq": [
    {"question": "How to film magic without exposing methods?", "answer": "Control framing precisely—only show what you want. Review footage before posting. Single continuous shots prove no camera tricks. Some angles naturally protect methods. Watch your own videos critically."},
    {"question": "Should magicians teach tricks on YouTube?", "answer": "Self-working tricks and basic principles fine. Marketed effects—never. Magic community has norms around exposure. Focus on presentation and theory. Performance videos safer than tutorials."},
    {"question": "Best camera for card magic?", "answer": "Any camera with good low-light performance and manual focus. 4K helpful for cropping. Overhead rig for table work. Sony A6400 or Canon M50 popular choices. Clean sensor matters for smooth shots."},
    {"question": "How important are reactions?", "answer": "Extremely—reactions sell magic to viewers. Film spectators alongside trick. Genuine surprised faces drive engagement. Some creators film reactions separately. Street magic format works because of reactions."}
