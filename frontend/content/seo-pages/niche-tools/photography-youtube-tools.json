    {"question": "Do I need two cameras?", "answer": "Helpful but not required. Many start by filming with their phone while showcasing their main camera. Upgrade to two bodies as you grow."},
    {"question": "What's the best software for screen recording?", "answer": "OBS Studio is free and excellent. ScreenFlow (Mac) and Camtasia offer more editing features. For Lightroom tutorials, any works."},
    {"question": "How do I show my camera screen clearly?", "answer": "Use an HDMI capture card like Elgato Cam Link. Records clean output from camera. Better than filming the screen."},
    {"question": "Should I show my face or just the screen?", "answer": "Both. Picture-in-picture with your face builds connection. Full screen for detailed editing. Switch between them."}
