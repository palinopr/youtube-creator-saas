  "faq": [
    {"question": "Do I need a drone license?", "answer": "For commercial real estate work, yes. FAA Part 107 certification is required in the US. Recreational use has different rules. Check local regulations."},
    {"question": "What's the best wide-angle lens?", "answer": "12-24mm range works well. Sony 12-24mm f/2.8, Canon RF 14-35mm, or even smartphone ultra-wide can work. Avoid fisheye distortion."},
    {"question": "Should I use 360 cameras?", "answer": "Virtual tours with 360 cameras like Ricoh Theta or Matterport are valuable for listings. For YouTube content, traditional video is more engaging."},
    {"question": "How do I handle dark interiors?", "answer": "Portable LED panels help. Shoot toward windows for backlighting. Some pros use HDR bracketing. Post-production can only do so much."}
