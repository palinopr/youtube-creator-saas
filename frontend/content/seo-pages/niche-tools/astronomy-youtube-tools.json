  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best camera for astrophotography?", "answer": "Sony A7S III excellent for video. Canon or Nikon full-frame for stills. Dedicated astronomy cameras for deep sky. Even entry DSLRs can capture impressive images. Full frame helps but isn't required."},
    {"question": "Do I need a telescope?", "answer": "Not for wide-field Milky Way shots—just camera and lens. Telescope for planets and deep sky objects. Star tracker for longer exposures without telescope. Start with camera, add telescope as you progress."},
    {"question": "How to find dark sky locations?", "answer": "Light pollution maps (darksitefinder.com). National parks often have dark skies. Higher elevation typically darker. Check moon phase—avoid full moon. Travel time often required for quality skies."},
    {"question": "Best content for astronomy channel?", "answer": "Celestial event coverage (eclipses, meteor showers) gets massive views. Educational explainers have lasting value. Processing tutorials help community. Gear reviews for beginners to experts."}
