  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best overhead setup for leatherwork?", "answer": "C-stand with boom arm for heavy cameras—most stable. Elgato articulating arm for lighter setups. Key is stability—any shake ruins overhead shots. Position camera directly above work area."},
    {"question": "Should I include work sounds?", "answer": "Yes—leathercraft sounds are satisfying. Cutting, stitching, burnishing have ASMR appeal. Many successful channels feature these sounds prominently. Separate audio recording can improve quality."},
    {"question": "Lighting for leather?", "answer": "Even diffused light prevents harsh shadows in tooled patterns. Side light can show texture. Consistent throughout video. LED panels at angles work well. Avoid direct overhead that flattens texture."},
    {"question": "What content works for leathercraft?", "answer": "Full project tutorials most popular. Tool reviews and comparisons. Technique breakdowns (edge finishing, stitching). Pattern/template shares. Satisfying compilation videos."}
