  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best macro setup for coins?", "answer": "True macro lens (60mm-100mm) ideal. Extension tubes on normal lens work for budget. Copy stand provides stability. 1:1 magnification shows all details. Higher than 1:1 for mint marks."},
    {"question": "How to light coins properly?", "answer": "Angled light shows relief and luster—experiment with angles. Axial lighting (through half-mirror) reduces shadows. Ring lights give even illumination. Multiple small lights offer flexibility. Dark background makes coins stand out."},
    {"question": "Handling coins on camera?", "answer": "Always use gloves—white cotton or nitrile. Hold by edges only. Demonstrate proper handling as education. Keep coins in holders when possible. Never clean coins on camera (controversial topic)."},
    {"question": "What coin content performs well?", "answer": "Coin roll hunting very popular—the hunt is entertaining. Error coin discoveries drive excitement. Grading explanations help beginners. Market updates for investors. Rare coin showcases for aspirational content."}
