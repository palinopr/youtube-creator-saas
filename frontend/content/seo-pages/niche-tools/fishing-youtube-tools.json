  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best camera for fishing YouTube?", "answer": "GoPro is the standard—waterproof, mountable everywhere, excellent quality. Add Insta360 for 360° flexibility. Higher-end mirrorless for beauty shots from shore."},
    {"question": "How to protect equipment on water?", "answer": "GoPro/Insta360 are naturally waterproof. Regular cameras need rain covers and dry bags. Floating straps prevent loss. Dry equipment immediately after use."},
    {"question": "How to film solo while fishing?", "answer": "Static mounts with continuous recording. 360 cameras let you reframe later. Start recording before fishing. Edit down to interesting moments."},
    {"question": "Best way to capture the catch?", "answer": "Chest mount for POV of fight. Static wide shot for landing. GoPro on rod or hat for unique angles. Multiple cameras increase your options."}
