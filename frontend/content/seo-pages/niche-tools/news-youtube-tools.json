    {"question": "How fast should I cover breaking news?", "answer": "Fast but accurate. First is good, wrong is disaster. Verify before posting. Being second with correct info beats being first with errors."},
    {"question": "How to avoid copyright with news clips?", "answer": "Fair use allows commentary/criticism but isn't guaranteed. Use short clips with substantial commentary. Transform, don't just repost."},
    {"question": "Should I go live or pre-record?", "answer": "Both. Live for breaking news and engagement. Pre-recorded for researched analysis. Match format to content type."},
    {"question": "How to stay objective?", "answer": "Clearly separate news from opinion. Label commentary as your take. Present multiple perspectives on complex issues. Cite sources."}
