    {"question": "Best camera for sailing?", "answer": "GoPro for action and deck work—fully waterproof. Sony A7C or similar for interviews and b-roll. iPhone in waterproof case for quick captures. Multiple cameras cover different needs."},
    {"question": "How to deal with wind noise?", "answer": "Deadcat/windscreen essential on any external mic. Lavalier mics under clothing. ADR voiceover in editing. Record in protected cockpit areas. Wind is sailing content's biggest audio challenge."},
    {"question": "Editing while sailing?", "answer": "MacBook Air popular—efficient on power. iPad Pro for lighter setup. Edit in port when possible. Solar panels help but power is always limited. Plan editing schedule around passages."},
    {"question": "How to upload at sea?", "answer": "Starlink changed everything—reliable offshore internet now possible. Otherwise marina WiFi or local SIM cards. Some sailors batch upload in port. Content calendar adapts to connectivity."}
