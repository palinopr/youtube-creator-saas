  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best camera for martial arts?", "answer": "Fast autofocus critical—Sony and Canon excel. High frame rate for slow motion technique breakdowns. If gym is dark, prioritize low-light performance. Multiple cheaper cameras often better than one expensive."},
    {"question": "How many camera angles?", "answer": "Minimum 2 for tutorials—front and side. 3-4 angles ideal for complex techniques. POV adds immersion. Edit between angles to show technique completely. Single angle limits instructional value."},
    {"question": "Filming in gyms with poor lighting?", "answer": "Portable LED panels help significantly. Increase ISO if needed. Open aperture lenses (f/1.8-2.8) gather more light. Position near windows if available. Some gyms allow temporary lighting."},
    {"question": "Slow motion for technique?", "answer": "Essential for martial arts—60fps minimum, 120fps+ ideal. Shows details invisible at full speed. Use for key moments, not entire video. Combine with real-time for context."}
