  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best onboard camera for model trains?", "answer": "Micro cameras designed for RC work well. Some purpose-built for model trains exist. Wireless preferred to avoid track interference. Balance quality with size—too heavy affects operation. Test compatibility with your scale."},
    {"question": "How to light a layout for video?", "answer": "LED strips in valance above layout popular. Avoid single-point sources that create shadows. Daylight-balanced LEDs (5500-6500K) for realism. Supplement building lights for night scenes. Even illumination is key."},
    {"question": "Audio in train videos?", "answer": "DCC sound locomotives add realism. Record layout sounds separately for better quality. Ambient sounds (bells, horns) matter. Consider adding subtle ambient audio. Voiceover for educational content."},
    {"question": "What video types perform best?", "answer": "Cab ride POV videos consistently popular—relaxing, immersive. Layout tours showcase your work. How-to tutorials help community. Operating sessions show the point of the hobby. Progress updates build invested audience."}
