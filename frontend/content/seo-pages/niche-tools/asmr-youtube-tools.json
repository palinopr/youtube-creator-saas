  "faq": [
    {"question": "Do I need a binaural microphone?", "answer": "Not required but highly valued by ASMR audiences. Dual condenser mics can create spatial audio too. Binaural is the gold standard for immersive experience."},
    {"question": "What's the best budget ASMR mic?", "answer": "Blue Yeti in stereo mode is a solid starting point. For dual setup, two Rode NT1s or Audio-Technica AT2020s work well."},
    {"question": "How important is room treatment?", "answer": "Critical. ASMR reveals every echo and background noise. Blankets, foam panels, or recording in closets helps. Complete silence is the goal."},
    {"question": "Can I do ASMR with my phone?", "answer": "Modern phones can work for basic ASMR, but dedicated microphones capture the subtleties that audiences expect. Upgrade early if you're serious."}
