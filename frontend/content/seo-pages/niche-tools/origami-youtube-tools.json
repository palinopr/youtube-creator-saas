  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best overhead setup for origami?", "answer": "Copy stand most stable. C-stand with boom arm works well. Elgato arm for desk setup. Position camera directly overhead looking down. No angle—pure overhead for fold clarity."},
    {"question": "What paper shows best on camera?", "answer": "Medium-weight paper with good contrast to background. Avoid very white paper under bright lights—can blow out. Colored paper often films better. Kami (origami paper) standard choice."},
    {"question": "Should I use ASMR sounds?", "answer": "Paper folding sounds are naturally satisfying. Many viewers enjoy pure paper sounds without music. Consider separate ASMR versions. Good microphone placement captures folds beautifully."},
    {"question": "How to show both hands and folds?", "answer": "Overhead camera shows hands naturally. Keep movements in frame. Practice fold sequence to avoid going out of frame. Some creators use face cam for complex explanations."}
