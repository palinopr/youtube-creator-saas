    {"question": "Do I need an expensive camera for tech reviews?", "answer": "You need good video quality, but mid-range cameras work fine. A Sony A6400 or Canon R10 with good lighting beats an expensive camera with poor lighting."},
    {"question": "How do tech YouTubers get review units?", "answer": "Build an audience first. Once you have consistent views and quality content, reach out to PR teams. Start with smaller brands, work up to major companies."},
    {"question": "What makes tech B-roll look professional?", "answer": "Shallow depth of field, smooth camera movement, dramatic lighting, slow motion, and clean backgrounds. Motion control (sliders, gimbals) elevates production value."},
    {"question": "What editing software do tech YouTubers use?", "answer": "Premiere Pro is most common, followed by DaVinci Resolve. Final Cut Pro for Mac users. DaVinci is free with professional color grading built in."}
