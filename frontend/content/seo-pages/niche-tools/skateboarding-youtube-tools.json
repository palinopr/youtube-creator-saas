  "faq": [
    {"question": "VX1000 vs modern camera?", "answer": "VX1000 has the classic look many love. Modern cameras offer 4K, slow-mo, easier workflow. Many creators use both—VX for aesthetic, modern for quality."},
    {"question": "Best fisheye lens?", "answer": "Opteka 6.5mm for DSLRs. Death Lens for phones. Vintage fisheye adapters for VX. The distorted wide look defines skate videos."},
    {"question": "How to film tricks well?", "answer": "Follow filming takes practice. Stay low, keep skater framed. Multiple attempts normal. Mix angles—fisheye follow, long lens profile, tripod wide."},
    {"question": "Do I need a filmer?", "answer": "Helps significantly. Self-filming possible with tripod and GoPro. Community filming is how most start—film each other, share clips."}
