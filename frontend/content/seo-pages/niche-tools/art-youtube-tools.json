    {"question": "Best way to film overhead?", "answer": "Articulating arm (Elgato, Amazon basics) attached to desk. Position camera directly above work. Mount needs to be sturdy."},
    {"question": "Talk while working or voiceover?", "answer": "Both work. Talking while working is more authentic but challenging. Voiceover gives more control. Many do hybrid."},
    {"question": "How long should art videos be?", "answer": "5-15 minutes for time-lapse with commentary. Full real-time for ASMR/relaxation content. Match format to audience expectation."},
    {"question": "Do I need expensive camera for art?", "answer": "Phone with overhead mount works well. Lighting matters more. Detail comes from positioning, not camera cost."}
