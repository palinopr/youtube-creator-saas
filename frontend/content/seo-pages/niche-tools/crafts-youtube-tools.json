  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best overhead camera setup?", "answer": "C-stand with arm, or wall-mounted boom. Phone with good stabilization works for beginners. Main camera recommended for quality."},
    {"question": "How to avoid hand shadows?", "answer": "Light from both sides, not directly above. Diffusion panels soften light. LED panels at 45-degree angles work well."},
    {"question": "Show face or just hands?", "answer": "Both is ideal. Face builds connection, hands show technique. Picture-in-picture works well. But hands-only channels succeed too."},
    {"question": "Handle messy projects?", "answer": "Clean as you go for video. Time-lapses hide mess. Dedicated filming space that can get dirty. Protect camera from debris."}
