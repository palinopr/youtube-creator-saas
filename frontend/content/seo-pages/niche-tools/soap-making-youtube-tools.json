  "faq": [
    {"question": "How to capture accurate soap colors?", "answer": "Daylight-balanced LEDs (5500K) most important. Custom white balance for each session. Avoid mixing light temperatures. Post-processing can help but start accurate. Test with known colors before filming."},
    {"question": "Best angle for soap making?", "answer": "Overhead for pours and mold work. Side angle shows layers and depth. 45-degree for personality shots. Cut reveal needs careful planning—often multiple angles. Consider viewer perspective."},
    {"question": "Should I speed up the process?", "answer": "Mix of real-time and time-lapse works best. Key moments in real-time (trace, pour, cut). Long curing as time-lapse. Viewers appreciate seeing technique at real speed. Edit out truly boring parts."},
    {"question": "Audio in soap videos?", "answer": "Mixing sounds are ASMR popular. Pour sounds satisfying. Voiceover for explanation. Some viewers love pure ASMR, others want tutorial. Consider offering both—separate ASMR versions can work well."}
