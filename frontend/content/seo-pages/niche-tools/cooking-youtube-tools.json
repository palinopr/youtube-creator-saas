  "faq": [
    {"question": "What camera do cooking YouTubers use?", "answer": "Many use Sony cameras (A6400, A7C) for their autofocus and color science. iPhones also work well for cooking content with proper lighting. The camera matters less than lighting."},
    {"question": "How do I get good overhead shots?", "answer": "Use a camera arm clamped to your counter or table. Products like Elgato Multi Mount or SmallRig arms provide stable positioning. Ensure your camera can tilt 90 degrees."},
    {"question": "Do I need to show my face in cooking videos?", "answer": "Not required. Many successful cooking channels show only hands and food. However, personality-driven channels with face cam tend to build stronger subscriber loyalty."},
    {"question": "How important is audio in cooking videos?", "answer": "Very important. Sizzling sounds, chopping, and commentary add to the experience. Invest in a directional mic that focuses on your voice while picking up cooking ASMR."}
