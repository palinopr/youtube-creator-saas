  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best camera for farm work?", "answer": "GoPro for hands-on work—mount and go. Sony A7C or similar for quality B-roll. iPhone for spontaneous moments. Rugged, weather-sealed important—farms are harsh on gear."},
    {"question": "Filming while doing farm chores?", "answer": "Chest or head mount GoPro frees hands. Set up cameras on tripods for tasks. Wireless lav for narration. Accept that some footage will be shaky—authenticity matters."},
    {"question": "How to handle outdoor audio?", "answer": "Wind is constant enemy—use dead cat windscreens always. Voiceover in post often cleaner. Embrace ambient farm sounds for atmosphere. Lav mics under clothing reduce wind."},
    {"question": "Drone for farm content?", "answer": "Excellent for property overview, project progress, livestock counts. DJI Mini series portable and capable. Check FAA rules. Great for seasonal comparison shots."}
