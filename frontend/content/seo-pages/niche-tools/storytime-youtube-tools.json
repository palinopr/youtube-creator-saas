    {"question": "Do I need to animate?", "answer": "No—many successful storytime channels are talking-head with edits. Animation is one style, not a requirement. Choose what fits your skills and resources."},
    {"question": "How long should storytime videos be?", "answer": "8-15 minutes is sweet spot. Long enough to develop story, short enough to maintain attention. Some successful longer stories exist but need strong pacing."},
    {"question": "Can I tell other people's stories?", "answer": "Be careful—give credit, get permission where needed. Original stories are safer. Reddit story channels have mixed legal standing. Original content is best."},
    {"question": "Best animation software for beginners?", "answer": "Vyond or Animaker for template-based. Procreate + simple cuts for illustrated style. Adobe Animate for serious animation investment."}
