  "faq": [
    {"question": "How to film glass without glare?", "answer": "Angle lights to avoid direct reflection. Polarizing filter can help. Diffused lighting reduces hot spots. Position camera carefully. Some reflection shows glass quality—balance control with realism."},
    {"question": "Best way to show finished pieces?", "answer": "Natural light through the piece is magical. Light box from behind shows colors. Window installation shots ideal. Rotate piece to show light catching different angles. Golden hour natural light stunning."},
    {"question": "Audio challenges in glass work?", "answer": "Grinder is loud—may need ADR/voiceover for those sections. Cutting glass has nice sounds. Soldering relatively quiet. Consider ASMR versions without grinder segments. Quality lavalier helps with voice."},
    {"question": "What content works for stained glass?", "answer": "Full project tutorials most popular. Pattern design and creation. Technique breakdowns (cutting curves, soldering tips). Material reviews. Restoration content has audience too."}
