    {"question": "How to show print quality clearly?", "answer": "Macro lens at 1:1 magnification. Side lighting reveals layer lines. Compare prints at same angle/lighting. Turntable rotation shows all sides."},
    {"question": "What's Octolapse and why use it?", "answer": "OctoPrint plugin that syncs camera capture with print head position. Creates smooth time-lapses without print head in frame. Industry standard for print content."},
    {"question": "Best lighting for 3D prints?", "answer": "Side lighting reveals texture and layer detail. Avoid flat front lighting that hides imperfections. Rotating light source for product shots shows different angles."}
