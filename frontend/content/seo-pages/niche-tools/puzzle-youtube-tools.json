  "faq": [
    {"question": "How long do puzzle videos take to make?", "answer": "Actual puzzling can be hours to days depending on piece count. Time-lapse condenses to 5-20 minutes. Some creators do multi-session videos. Plan for long capture times."},
    {"question": "Best camera for puzzle time-lapse?", "answer": "Cameras with built-in intervalometer. GoPro works for simpler setups. DSLR/mirrorless with AC adapter for long sessions. Phone with time-lapse app possible for shorter puzzles."},
    {"question": "Overhead mount for puzzle table?", "answer": "C-stand with boom arm most common. Wall-mounted arm works for dedicated space. Must be stable for time-lapse—any movement shows. Position to capture full table."},
    {"question": "What puzzle content performs best?", "answer": "Satisfying time-lapse completions most viewed. Relaxing real-time for background watching. Reviews help purchase decisions. 'Impossible' or difficult puzzles create tension. Mix content types."}
