  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best font size for code?", "answer": "16-20pt minimum. Test on phone—if you can't read it, viewers can't either. Bigger is better for video."},
    {"question": "Should I use face cam?", "answer": "Optional for coding. Many successful channels are screencast only. Face helps with explanation moments but not required."},
    {"question": "How to handle typing sounds?", "answer": "Quiet keyboard, good mic placement, or voiceover after. Some viewers like typing ASMR, others find it distracting."},
    {"question": "What about live coding vs edited?", "answer": "Edited tutorials are cleaner—cut mistakes, add callouts. Live coding is more authentic, shows real problem-solving. Both work."}
