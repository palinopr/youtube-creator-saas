  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best camera for bird video?", "answer": "Sony A1 or Canon R5 top choices—fast AF, high frame rate. Crop sensor cameras give extra reach. Panasonic GH6 budget option. Lens matters as much as body. 600mm equivalent minimum for most situations."},
    {"question": "How to get close to birds?", "answer": "Patience and stillness over approaching. Blinds and hides work well. Learn bird behavior—know where they'll go. Camouflage helps. Regular presence conditions them to you. Never harass for content."},
    {"question": "Recording bird sounds?", "answer": "Parabolic microphone for distance recording. Shotgun mic for closer sounds. Record separate from video for better quality. Apps help identify calls. Ambient forest sound adds atmosphere."},
    {"question": "Best time to film birds?", "answer": "Early morning—birds most active at dawn. Golden hour light is beautiful. Spring for migration and breeding activity. Winter feeders concentrate birds. Know your target species' habits."}
