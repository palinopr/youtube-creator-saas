  "faq": [
    {"question": "Do I need multiple cameras?", "answer": "One camera works, but cuts between speakers keeps viewers engaged. Even two cameras (one per host) significantly improves the viewing experience."},
    {"question": "What's the best remote recording tool?", "answer": "Riverside.fm and Squadcast lead for quality. They record locally on each participant's device, then sync the high-quality files."},
    {"question": "How do I create clips for social media?", "answer": "Tools like Opus Clip, Descript, or manual editing in Premiere/CapCut. Short vertical clips with captions perform best on social."},
    {"question": "Should I upload full episodes to YouTube?", "answer": "Yes, plus highlight clips as Shorts. Full episodes build watch time and subscribers. Clips drive discovery."}
