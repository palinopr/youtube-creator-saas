  "faq": [
    {"question": "Do I need a face cam for commentary?", "answer": "Not required. Many successful creators are voice-only with B-roll. Face cam adds personality but isn't essential for video essays."},
    {"question": "How do I avoid copyright issues with clips?", "answer": "Use clips for commentary and criticism (fair use). Keep clips short. Transform with analysis. When in doubt, describe instead of showing."},
    {"question": "How long should video essays be?", "answer": "As long as needed. 10-30 minutes is common. Longer (1+ hour) for deep dives. Shorter for focused takes. Quality and pacing matter more than length."},
    {"question": "What software for scripting?", "answer": "Whatever works for you. Google Docs, Notion, Scrivener. Some write directly in editing software. Find your flow."}
