  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best lens for interior filming?", "answer": "Wide angle—16-35mm range. Rooms look bigger, more inviting. Standard 50mm often too tight for interiors."},
    {"question": "How to light dark rooms?", "answer": "Open all curtains, shoot during day, use bounce boards. Add practical lamps in frame. Avoid harsh artificial lighting."},
    {"question": "Should I stage my home?", "answer": "Light styling yes—declutter, arrange thoughtfully. But authenticity matters too. Overly staged can feel fake."},
    {"question": "How to do smooth room reveals?", "answer": "Gimbal is ideal. Walk slowly, keep movement smooth. Slider for static reveals. Stabilization in post helps too."}
