  "faq": [
    {"question": "Best macro lens for miniatures?", "answer": "60mm or 90mm macro lenses popular. Sony 90mm, Canon 100mm excellent. Even kit lens with extension tubes works. True 1:1 macro ratio ideal for 28mm scale."},
    {"question": "How to light metallic paint?", "answer": "Larger light sources reduce harsh reflections. Light tents work well. Experiment with angles—metallic reflects differently. Some creators prefer controlled single source for NMM."},
    {"question": "Filming painting process?", "answer": "Overhead camera for painting. Side angle for holding mini. Time-lapse long sessions. Real-time for technique explanations. Multiple camera angles add production value."},
    {"question": "Focus stacking for photos?", "answer": "Multiple images at different focus points, combined in software. Helicon Focus, Photoshop work. Critical for final showcase shots where entire mini must be sharp. Less relevant for video."}
