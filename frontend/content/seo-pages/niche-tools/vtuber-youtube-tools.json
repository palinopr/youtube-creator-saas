  "faq": [
    {"question": "How much does VTubing cost to start?", "answer": "Free with VRoid + VSeeFace + webcam. Professional Live2D avatar: $500-$2000+ commission. Tracking improves dramatically with iPhone."},
    {"question": "Do I need a powerful computer?", "answer": "Running avatar tracking + game + streaming is demanding. Good CPU, 16GB+ RAM, dedicated GPU recommended. Test before investing in avatar."},
    {"question": "2D vs 3D avatar?", "answer": "2D (Live2D) is industry standard, looks polished. 3D offers more movement freedom. 2D generally looks more professional currently."},
    {"question": "Can I VTube without showing my real face?", "answer": "That's the whole point! Avatar represents you. But you do need webcam/iPhone pointed at your face for tracking."}
